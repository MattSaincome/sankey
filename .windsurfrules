You are making a financial analysis chart. Only work on one widget at a time. Never push to github without approval from me.
Don't make any changes to the sankey income statement chart widget unless I approve it. It works great now, and shouldn't be touched.
This investor bot is trained and given the prompt via open AI to give investors and users of our product and our app advice on how to look at publicly traded companies from the perspective of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and value investors like Ben Graham right now it does work it gives this advice but we need to make it better and here's how I want to make it better:

 I want to create a system that uses rag retrieval mechanisms to digest and understand every single shareholder letter that Berkshire Hathaway has ever wrote and I want it to contextualize all of the stuff in these letters and understand all of the advice and wisdom and then I want it to be able to pull up quotes wisdom comparisons and advice from these letters and the knowledge contains in these letters based on the company that the user and investor is talking to the value investor bought about for example if the value investor bought is being asked questions about an energy company we don't need to just search the letters to see if Warren Buffett had ever invested in that energy company but rather we want to see how he thinks about energy company investments in general and fine the most relevant pieces of wisdom and quotes. An additional example might be:  Let's say that the user and investor is considering making an investment in a unprofitable business so regardless of which industry it's in it's an unprofitable business what is Warren Buffett said about making investments in unprofitable businesses has he ever done it before has he ever done it and it went well has he ever done it and it didn't go well we want to bring that wisdom and knowledge to life with our value investor bought so this RAG wisdom system needs to be able to understand the types of businesses that are being discussed and find matching wisdom from Warren Buffett's letters and Charlie Munger's letters and the transcripts of their public meetings where they discuss their investment philosophy.

 Now I know that there are many different ways to go about this but one thing that I want to highlight to you which I think is very important is that the investor bot which is powered by open ai needs to have access to these pieces of wisdom and quotes and context so that it can respond in real time such that a user can send a message and the very next message back from the investor bot has identified in surface these relevant contextual quotes and wisdom from all of our systems related to Warren Buffett's letters public remarks Charlie Munger Berkshire Hathaway et cetera I think that this is likely RAG system but it needs to integrate perfectly with this chat bot I think that that means likely that we need to find these pieces of wisdom and context in one step and then in the next step we need to add them to the users messages to the open ai chat bot so that it itself has the context and has the option but not the requirement to intelligently decide when these quotes and wisdom should be weaved into the conversation or highlighted as a specific quote that's relevant

 So this is a complex thing and what I need you to do right now is I need you to look at the code that we have currently and map out a strategy based on the following impleentaion plan.

 It's also important to note that I've already downloaded all of the materials and Pdfs and HTML files from the Berkshire Hathaway letters and transcripts from their public meetings and remarks and some of Charlie Mungers letters and this is going to be our key source information you don't need to download additional information just use the files here, including subfolders and the files in them.
