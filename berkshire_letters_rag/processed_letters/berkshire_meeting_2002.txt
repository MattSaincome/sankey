In 2002, you suggested that shareholders who thought they were eligible to send in their 
qualifications if they were interested in seeking a seat on your board of directors. 
And, again, in your 2006 letter, when you advertised for a successor to Lou Simpson at GEICO, 
you said at the time “Send me your resume.” 
In the past, you have discussed your views on short selling. You have cited that stocks tend to 
rise over time, and you’ve talked about the asymmetry between reward and risk. 
By contrast, the last 15 years has demonstrated that short selling can be a value additive tool to 
total return when done by professionals. In fact, I believe Todd Combs had success as a short 
seller when you hired him. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: He had so much success he stopped doing it. (Laughter and applause) 
DOUG KASS: Yes, Charlie, but he got the job from that success. My question is — 
WARREN BUFFETT: No, no, he didn’t. (Laughs) 
Can’t slide that one in there, Doug. (Laughter) 
DOUG KASS: My question is: would you ever consider committing capital to a short-selling 
strategy? Would you or Berkshire consider being my Homer Dodge, who invested in your 
partnership after the original seven investors? 
Would you or Berkshire Hathaway be willing to give my firm at least $100 million in a managed 
account? 
If Seabreeze failed to outperform the increase, during the two-year period, of the book value 
increase in Berkshire, all the earned fees earned would be contributed half to the Sherwood 
Foundation, and half to two charities of my choice, including the Jewish Federation of Palm 
Beach County? 
And even if Seabreeze outperformed Berkshire’s change in book value, 25 percent of the 
earned fees would be contributed to the charities. 
And I want to add something else. You talked about being technophobic. 
Technology may be very hard for Berkshire to invest in, but it is also disruptive to many 
industries whose business models are scathed by it, and this produces very fertile ground for 
short-selling opportunities. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we got to — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Let me add to that. 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK — 1:55 without an ad, but — (laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: The answer to your question is no. (Laughter and applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie and I are no strangers to short selling. I mean, we both — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Failed at it. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. (Laughter) 
So we’ll — just think about how lucky you are. You don’t have the competition from all kinds of 
people that listen to us or — ourselves. 
No, we — I may even propose a little wager at some point, but we’ll let that ride for the time 
being. 
I’ve known — well, if you go back far enough, you know, we did a reasonable amount of short 
selling, and I’ve certainly identified lots of companies that I thought were far overpriced, and 
I’ve identified a fair number of companies that I not only thought, but was virtually certain, 
were frauds. And so, Charlie — we’ve been seeing them ever since we got in the business. 
But making a lot of money short selling, still, is not a game that appeals to us over a long period 
of time. It’s one of those things that — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We don’t like trading agony for money. (Applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: But we wish you well. (Laughter) 
12. Reluctantly paying more for a great business 
WARREN BUFFETT: Station 4. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ben Sauer (PH) from Shreveport, Louisiana. 
Could you be more specific about what factors you considered when determining what a fair 
price was for an acquisition such as Heinz? 
And also, what sources do you use to make judgments about major changes that will affect an 
industry? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we usually — we usually feel we’re paying too much. Isn’t that right, 
Charlie? (Laughs) 
But we find the business so compelling, the management, our associates, so compelling, that 
we gag and we get there on the price. 
But we — there is no mathematical — perfect mathematical — formula. 
Looking back, when we’ve bought wonderful businesses that turned out to continue to be 
wonderful, we could’ve paid significantly more money, and they still would have been great 
business decisions. But you never know 100 percent for sure. 
And so it isn’t as precise as you might think. Generally speaking, if you get a chance to buy a 
wonderful business — and by that, I would mean one that has economic characteristics that 
lead you to believe, with a high degree of certainty, that they will be earning unusual returns on 
capital over time — unusually high — and, better yet, if they get the chance to employ more 
capital at — again, at high rates of return — that’s the best of all businesses. And you probably 
should stretch a little. 
Charlie and I have had several conversations where we were looking at a building — a business 
— which we liked, and were sort of gagging at the price, and Charlie or I will say, you know, 
“Let’s do it,” even though it kind of kills us to pay that last 5 percent. 
We did that with See’s Candy. Charlie was the one that said, “For God’s sakes, Warren, write 
the check.” I was the one that was suffering. 
But it’s happened quite a few times, hasn’t it, Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: It almost always happens. (Laughter) 
Modern prices are not cheap. 
WARREN BUFFETT: No, no. And great businesses, you know, you’re not going to find lots of 
them, and you’re not going to get the opportunity to buy them and — although you do in the 
market. 
The stock market will offer you opportunities for profit, percentage-wise, that you’ll never see, 
in terms of negotiated purchase of business. 
In negotiated purchase of a business, you’re almost always dealing with someone that has the 
option of either selling or not selling, and can sort of pick the time when they decide to sell, and 
all of that sort of thing. 
In stock markets, it’s an auction market. Crazy things can happen. 
You can have, you know, some technological blip that will cause a flash crash or something. And 
the world really hasn’t changed at all, but all kinds of selling mechanisms are tripped off, and 
that sort of thing. 
So you will see opportunities in the stock market that you’ll never really get in the business 
market. 
But what we really like, we really like buying businesses to hold and keep. We like buying cheap 
marketable securities, too. But particularly when you’ve got lots of cash coming in and you’re 
going to continue to have lots of cash coming in, you really want to deploy it in great businesses 
that you can own forever. 
Charlie, anything? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. It — we’re sort of in a different mode now, and that has a great lesson, 
in that if we’d kept our earlier modes, if we’d never learned, we wouldn’t have done very well. 
The game of life is a game of everlasting learning. At least it is if you want to win. 
WARREN BUFFETT: We want to win. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. 
13. George W. Bush’s 10 words of economic wisdom 
WARREN BUFFETT: Carol. 
CAROL LOOMIS: This question is from Logan Reed (PH) of Pawling, New York, and has both a 
question and a postscript, and I’m going to do the postscript first. It’s friendly. 
“I’m an 86-year-old World War II vet, which puts me about halfway between you and Mr. 
Munger. I would respectfully and urgently request that you quit eating so many hamburgers. 
(Laughter) 
“Those things plug up your arteries, and I want to keep you around for a while, in spite of the 
fact” — the unfriendliness comes in here — “that you voted for President Obama.” (Laughter) 
Now, here is the question. 
WARREN BUFFETT: This guy is trying to kill me, and he’s doing it — (Laughter) 
CAROL LOOMIS: “Over the years, you’ve frequently alluded to your legendary reputation for 
thriftiness, and you’ve extolled the virtues of the managers of Berkshire companies who have 
invariably been extremely cost conscious. 
“If these are hallmarks of the philosophy which has enabled you to achieve your astounding 
success, how can you possibly support an administration which has plunged our country into 
$16 trillion worth of debt, and has not indicated the slightest concern — (applause) — over the 
efficiency — inefficiency — over the inefficiency of big government?” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, the 16 trillion, we’ll have to give Bush a certain amount of credit 
for that, too. (Applause) 
They certainly didn’t — certainly wasn’t — the Obama administration that, at least, allowed 
policy that created the greatest financial crisis and required an appropriate stimulus on the part 
of the government. (Applause) 
But, in the end, I find it totally unproductive — and that fellow at 86 probably is — should have 
found it out by now — to discuss politics with people. I mean, you’re to have roughly half agree 
with you and half disagree. 
So if you — if you look at this — the trouble is, Charlie and I, even though he’s a Republican, I’m 
a Democrat, we really don’t disagree as much as you might think based on that. 
Otherwise, I could say you could just take your pick here and vote for one of us and ignore the 
other one, and we would offer a little something for everyone. 
The amount of deficit spending in the last four years, the amount of stimulus provided — fiscal 
stimulus provided — I think, has been quite appropriate in relation to the threat to the 
economy that was posed by the greatest panic in my lifetime. 
I mean, you literally had a situation where Berkshire Hathaway was getting a phone call 
because General Electric needed money, and we were the last stop. 
That is quite a situation. It’s quite a situation when Freddie and Fannie go into conservatorship 
and WaMu and Wachovia fail, and where money market funds have 5 percent drained out of 
them in three days, and with a panic underway. 
So I — we needed fiscal stimulus in this country. 
Now, the real question is: how do you get off of that? And that is a problem, but it’s a lesser 
problem than we would’ve had if we’d decided to follow some austerity program, in my view, 
at least, starting in 2008. 
How do you feel about that, Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I agree with you completely. (Applause) 
And, by the way, so did George W. Bush. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: That was bipartisan. We were in so much trouble, that on both sides of the 
aisle, we finally got together and supported these extreme interventions. 
WARREN BUFFETT: George Bush issued, probably, the ten greatest words of economic thought 
in history. Most people don’t give him credit for that. 
They think of Adam Smith and comparative advantage and Keynes and animal spirits and all 
those guys. 
But George Bush went out there in September of 2008 and said, “If money doesn’t loosen up, 
this sucker could go down.” (Laughter) 
I mean, that is a man that knew how to get to the point. (Laughter) 
And I give him great credit for it, enormous credit. 
And plenty of members of his party did not agree with what he was doing, but we owe him a 
lot, in that respect. 
And, you know, we — our leaders, generally speaking, in both parties, once they were in the 
terrible trouble, I think they behaved, or came up with policies that, in general, were very useful 
in avoiding something far worse than what we experienced. 
And they weren’t easy to do. I mean, it took some guts. 
So, I am disturbed by a national debt that grows in respect to GDP. In fact, I wrote an article in 
The New York Times, an op-ed piece, in — I think maybe 2009 or 2010 — talking about this very 
problem. 
But, you know, we came out of World War II with a debt higher — a gross or net debt — higher 
in relation to GDP than we have now, and people were predicting terrible things at that time 
because of that situation, and the country has done sensationally. 
The real danger is that it just continues to grow, and it gets easier to print money than exercise 
some discipline. 
But we’ve encountered far worse problems than we face now. I mean, this is not our country’s 
toughest hour, by a huge margin. 
And I think we will do fine, but with a lot of bickering, and kind of nonsense that will bother you 
when you read about it day to day. But when you look at it from a viewpoint of history 10 or 20 
years from now, you will not be that disturbed. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I agree with you about George W. Bush, and I like these nonpartisan 
episodes when we get together and do things right. 
And I also think that our current problems are quite confusing. In fact, if you aren’t confused, I 
don’t think you understand it very well. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: That sort of immunizes you from everything. (Laughs) 
How bothered are you by the level of debt in relation to GDP? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don’t think there’s any one fixed ratio that is written in the stars. 
As a matter of fact, most of the debt, as I conceive it, is not even counted in what you call 
“debt.” The off-the-books debt of the United States is bigger than the on-the-books debt, all the 
present value of future promises that are unfunded. 
WARREN BUFFETT: That can be changed, however. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. But, if they can be changed, but are we really going to take Social 
Security away from somebody who’s worked a lifetime? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we shouldn’t. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I don’t think it’s very likely. 
WARREN BUFFETT: No, no. But Social Security is not a killer, actually, in terms — if you have a 
GDP that rises a couple percent in real terms — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course — that’s the great problem. All of our problems are trivial, if GDP 
will just rise at 2 percent per annum, per capita. 
All these problems that the Republicans are screaming about fade into insignificance if we can 
do that. 
But you’ve got to have policies that enable you to do it, and I’m not sure we always do that very 
well. (Applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Stay tuned. 
14. Benjamin Moore won’t go downmarket 
WARREN BUFFETT: Jonathan. 
JONATHAN BRANDT: I have a question about the competitive landscape in the paint business. 
I personally always use Benjamin Moore, but some say that Benjamin Moore is disadvantaged 
because it doesn’t control its own distribution, as does Sherwin-Williams, and they note that it 
has lost market share to Behr, which is sold in the home centers at lower prices. 
You recently replaced management there. What changes in strategy and/or pricing, if any, are 
being undertaken at that unit, and what is the outlook for that franchise? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Benjamin Moore, it’s a relatively small percentage of the total paint 
industry, but it — at the high end, it is the best regarded paint, and we have not lost position in 
that respect. 
But the — when we purchased Benjamin Moore, I made a promise. I even made a video. It had 
a dealer system, and people that invested their savings and passed on from generation to 
generation dealerships from Benjamin Moore, and counted on the company adhering to a 
dealer system, even though you could always get a huge jump in volume, particularly in the first 
year, if you went with the big boxes. 
So we were always approached by the big boxes, and they said, you know, “Let us take 
Benjamin Moore into our stores,” whether it be Home Depot or whomever. And we would’ve 
gotten a big jump in volume when that happened and they would’ve loved us — to have us — 
as a brand with that kind of identity in their stores, but it would’ve represented a total change 
in the distribution arrangement. 
I don’t think it would’ve worked out as well over time, and I know it would have been 
essentially — particularly after my pledge, which the other — which the management pledged 
too, they would’ve been double-crossing a network of dealers that trusted us, and trusted us 
when we bought it to continue with the policy. 
A dealer policy will work with a first-class brand like Benjamin Moore. It will never get the kind 
of market share as will take a Behr, which is distributed through Home Depot. 
We were actually offered Behr at one time. Charlie, do you remember that one? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes, I do. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, yeah. But the company was actually investigating, and went on its 
way to implementing, some moves that would’ve, in effect, gutted, or we felt would drastically 
hurt the dealers and violate the pledge that I’d made to them back when we bought it. 
So we did have a change there. And we will — we will not follow the Sherwin-Williams path, 
which is a very — I mean, it’s a very effective business strategy. I’m not knocking that at all, but 
that is not our strategy. Our strategy will be a dealer strategy, focused on the high end of the 
market. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Besides, it’s worked very well. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, yeah, it’s worked well, and it’ll continue to work well. 
It doesn’t mean that Sherwin-Williams won’t do extremely well. I think they will. It doesn’t 
mean that Behr won’t do well. I think they will. 
But we are in a different segment and it’s up to us to protect and really foster the dealer 
distribution network, and I think we can have something, and do have something, very special 
with those dealers and with the position that Benjamin Moore has. 
But it will not lead to far higher market shares or anything. I think it will lead — and it has — to 
very decent profitability. Benjamin Moore is a good business, and I think it will continue to be a 
good business. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I agree totally. I always wish we could buy five more like it tomorrow. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, exactly. 
15. Stock strategy 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 5. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Derek Foster, Ottawa, Canada. 
First of all, thank you, Warren, for sharing all your information. You’ve changed my life. I took 
finance in university, couldn’t understand Greek formulas, but now I can invest reasonably well. 
My question to you is, in the past you’ve said for an investor, you should simply — for 99 
percent of investors — you should simply stick money in an index fund and let it go and don’t 
worry about it. Those 1 percent of investors, choose your best five stocks and put a substantial 
amount of money in it. 
I’m just wondering, how about a strategy of, perhaps, buying 20 of the best stocks in America, 
you know, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, whatever, the companies that 
have been around for centuries — or a century or decades or whatever — and just leaving it at 
that. 
Do you think that that would outperform an index fund over the long term? And I want 
Charlie’s opinion as well. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I don’t know whether you’re saying the 20 largest companies or the 
20 best. You might get different thoughts from different people on what they are. 
But I think you would — probably the 20 you would pick would virtually match the results of an 
index fund. Who knows exactly which ones would be the best? 
But the real distinction — and Graham made this in his book, basically — is between the person 
who is going to spend an appreciable amount of time becoming something of an expert on 
businesses, because that’s what stocks are, or the person who is going to be busy with another 
profession, wants to own equities, and actually will actually do very well in equities. But the real 
problem they have is that they may tend to get excited about stocks at the wrong time. 
You know, they, really, the idea of buying an index fund over time is not to buy stocks at the 
right time or the right stocks. It’s to avoid buying them at the wrong time, the wrong stocks. 
So equities will do well over time, and you just have to avoid getting — you know, getting 
excited when other people are excited, or getting excited about certain industries when other 
people are, trying to behave like a professional when you aren’t spending the time and bringing 
what’s needed to the game to be a professional. 
And if you’re an amateur investor, there’s nothing wrong with being an amateur investor, and 
you just simply — you’ve got a very logical, profitable course of action available to you, and that 
is simply to buy into American business in a broadly diversified way and put your money in over 
time. 
So I would say your group of 20 will probably match an index fund, and you’ll probably do well 
in that, and you will do well in an index fund. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I have nothing to add. I do think it’s — that knowing the edge of your 
own competency is very important. If you think you know a lot more than you do, well, you’re 
really asking for a lot of trouble. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. And that’s true outside of investments, too. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. Works particularly well in matrimony. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Do you want to give any other advice on that subject? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. 
WARREN BUFFETT: He gave it in the movie. I saw people taking notes. 
16. Are Buffett’s stock donations hurting Berkshire’s price? 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Becky? 
BECKY QUICK: This question comes from James Brodbelt Harris of Columbus, Ohio. 
He says that your enormously generous multibillion charitable gifts of Berkshire Hathaway stock 
over the past decade have, and will continue to be, sources of salable assets for the charities 
linked to the Buffett, Gates, and Munger families. 
Could annual sales of billions of dollars’ worth of donated stock by these charitable foundations 
be a reason why shares have traded under 120 percent of book value, and will announced 
share repurchase plans fully address this selling by the charitable funds in the coming decade? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. I give away 4 3/4 percent of my stock, we’ll say, every year, and let’s 
say that’s $2 billion worth of stock, roughly. That’s 1 percent — a little less than 1 percent — of 
the market value of Berkshire. 
Many companies in the New York Stock Exchange trade over 100 percent a year. A 1 percent 
sale annually of the outstanding capitalization is absolutely peanuts, and you can even argue, in 
some cases, that it can aid, in terms of market price, because the availability of stocks 
sometimes determines whether people get interested in buying. 
But a supply of 1 percent annually is not going to change the level at which a stock trades. I 
mean, it just it’s insignificant compared to the volume. 
Berkshire — I think Berkshire’s volume, A and B combined, is — probably averages, what, 4 or 
$500 million a day, so 2 billion spent over a year is not going to affect things. 
And you can argue that, you know, everybody else has a right to sell their stock or give it to a 
charity. I don’t think I should be totally tied up, in terms of being able to give the stock away. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, there’s nothing so insignificant as an extra $2 billion to an old man. 
(Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: I’ve never given away a penny that in any way changed my life. Have you, 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No, of course not. 
WARREN BUFFETT: We never even thought of it. (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: It would be unthinkable. 
WARREN BUFFETT: It’s — it has a lot more utility in the hands of other people than it does in 
my safe deposit box. 
17. Most of our opportunities will be in the U.S. 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Cliff? (Applause) 
CLIFF GALLANT: Looking over your first quarter results in the 10-Q, I was wondering — and this 
might apply more to the noninsurance businesses — what are you seeing in terms of reading 
the tea leaves for the U.S. economy right now? 
Are you starting to see lift? And I’m curious if you have any — if you feel any — need to start to 
expand Berkshire internationally outside of the U.S.? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we’re willing to go, you know, anyplace where we think we 
understand what things are — in a reasonable way— what things are going to look like in five 
or 10 years, and where we get our money’s worth, and good management, and all of the things 
that we emphasize. 
But — so we don’t — we’ve never foreclosed anything, but we’re going to find most of our 
opportunities in the United States. It’s just the nature of things that this is a huge, huge market 
for businesses, and we’re better known here. 
But, you know, most of our deals will take place here, but we find things outside the United 
States, particularly in terms of bolt-on acquisitions. 
In terms of current business, ever since the fall of 2009, coming on four years, we’ve seen a 
gradual improvement. And sometimes people have gotten encouraged to think it was speeding 
up quite a bit, and then they get feeling that — they start talking about a double-dip, which I’ve 
never believed in and hasn’t happened. 
What we see overall is just a slow progress in the American economy. You saw those figures on 
carloadings for the first 17 weeks. And, you know, we were up 3-and-a-fraction percent, but the 
other railroads were up 4/10 of a percent, so the industry as a whole might be up 1 percent or 
thereabouts, a little over 1 percent. 
This economy is not — for the last four years — it’s not come roaring back in any way, shape, or 
form. 
It’s never faltered, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it keeps going this way. 
Now, finally, the overhang in housing ended — it ended about a year ago — but — so we’re 
starting to get — we’re seeing some recovery in home prices, which has a big psychological 
effect, and we’re seeing some improvement in construction. 
But we don’t want to start overbuilding again. We really want to have housing starts that more 
or less equal household formation. And I think we’re seeing that. 
So if you ask me where we’re going to be when we meet here next year, you know, I think we 
will have moved forward. 
But I don’t think it will be in any surge of any sort, but I don’t think we’ll stall, either. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, it’s not a field where — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: — I’ve been good. 
WARREN BUFFETT: We do know what’s going on now, though. I mean — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, we know what’s going on now. 
WARREN BUFFETT: And I guess that ends it? (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Can’t make a lot of money knowing what’s going on now. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: And you can’t make a lot of money thinking you know what’s going to go on 
tomorrow if you don’t, either. 
We will — we’ll just keep — we keep playing the game. I mean — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, we keep playing the game. 
WARREN BUFFETT: And if we hear about something tomorrow that we can spend 15 or $20 
billion on and we feel we like the business, United States or otherwise, we’ll move in an instant, 
and if we don’t, we won’t do anything. 
And we just never know when opportunity is going to come along, but it does come along from 
time to time. And sometimes in financial markets, it comes in a huge way. I mean, that will 
happen from time to time. 
We may not see very many more, but most of the people in this room will see four or five times 
in their — during their lifetimes — they will see incredible opportunities offered in — probably 
in equity markets — but maybe in bond markets as well. 
People — things will happen, and then, you know, you have to be able to act, and then you 
have — and that means both in terms of having the ability and also having the mental fortitude 
to jump in when most people are jumping out. OK. Station 6. Charlie, you want to — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. 
18. How should a young money manager attract investors? 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 6. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Brandon from Los Angeles. 
I’m in my 20s and I’m starting a partnership. What advice do you have about getting people to 
put in money before I have a track record as a solo investor? (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you haven’t sold me. (Laughter) 
No, I think people should be quite cautious about investing money with other people, even 
when they have a track record, incidentally. There are a lot of track records that don’t mean 
much. 
But overall, I would advise any young person that wants to manage money, and wants to 
attract money later on, to start developing an audited track record as early as they can. 
I mean, it was far from the sole reason, far from the sole reason, that we hired Todd and Ted, 
but we certainly looked at their record, and we looked at a record that we both believed and 
could understand, because we see a lot of records that we don’t really think mean much. 
I mean, if you get — you know, if you have a coin flipping contest, as I wrote, you know, some 
years ago, and you get 310 million orangutans out there and they all flip coins and they flip 
them 10 times, you know, you will — instead of having 300 million left, you’ll have 300,000, 
roughly, left that’ll flip ten times in a row successfully. 
And those orangutans will probably go around trying to attract a lot of money to back them in 
future coin flipping contests. 
So it’s our job when we hire somebody to manage money to figure out whether they’ve been 
lucky coin flippers or whether they really know what they’re — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: When you had his problem, didn’t you scrape together about $100,000 
from a loving family? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, I hope they kept loving me after they gave me the money. That 
was — 
Well, it was very slow, and it should have been very slow. As Charlie has pointed out, some 
people thought I was running a Ponzi scheme, probably, there. 
And other people may not have thought it, but it was to their advantage to sort of scare people 
because they were selling investments in Omaha. 
But you — to attract money, you should deserve money, and you should develop a record over 
time that — and then you should be able to explain to people why that record is a product of 
sound thinking rather than simply being in tune with a trend or simply just being lucky. 
Charlie? You’re starting today and you’re 25 years old. How do you attract money? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I think most people start with friends and family, or people whose trust 
they’ve already earned in some other way. So it’s hard to do when you’re young, and that’s why 
people start so small. 
WARREN BUFFETT: And a relatively few will be successful. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s right, too. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Some of them — a great many will be successful and make — I mean, you 
know, we have the hedge fund record here. And during that time, the hedge fund managers 
have probably made a very considerable amount of money. 
As I pointed out, Todd and Ted, working under a 2 and 20 arrangement, if they put the money 
in a hole in the ground, would make $120 million each this year. 
So it’s not exactly an arrangement that you don’t want to think about a little bit before you 
engage in it. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: The arithmetic attracts many of the wrong sort of people. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Naturally, we thought we were exceptions. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. 
19. Is Ajit Jain going to run Berkshire after Buffett? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Andrew? 
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: OK. At Berkshire, there is a unique dynamic that exists between your 
recognition of Ajit’s special skills and Ajit’s special skills. 
You comment often about how unique Ajit’s skills are. So just tell us, is Ajit your successor? 
(Buffett laughs) 
And if not, what happens to Ajit’s businesses without Ajit? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, they won’t be without Ajit for a long time. And he — what — he’s 
remarkable in many ways, but one of the ways he’s particularly remarkable is that when people 
start copying something he’s doing and turning what was maybe quite profitable into 
something that becomes something every Tom, Dick, and Harry is doing, he figures out new 
ways to do business. 
And I notice you started with the ‘A’s when you started on a possible successor with Ajit, and 
you won’t have any more luck when you get to the ’B’s. (Laughs) 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think the basic answer is that if Ajit ever is not with us — 
WARREN BUFFETT: We won’t look as good. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, we won’t look as good, right. 
WARREN BUFFETT: And that’s true of a number of other managers, too. We have an 
extraordinary group of people, in most cases, who do not need the money that they earn 
working for us. They may make substantial money. And they are doing a job for you 
shareholders and for me and Charlie that you can almost say we don’t deserve. 
But they are having — I think they’re having — a good time running their businesses. The one 
thing we do is try and create an atmosphere where they can enjoy running the businesses 
rather than spend all their time running back and forth to headquarters and doing show-and-
tell operations and that sort of thing. 
And it’s taken a long time, though, too. I mean, we operated Berkshire for 20 years without Ajit. 
If he’d come in the office in 1965 instead of 1985, we’d probably own the world. (Laughter) 
Kind of fun to think about, isn’t it? 
Charlie? 
20. Howard Buffett’s role after his father isn’t running Berkshire 
WARREN BUFFETT: Doug? 
DOUG KASS: Howard, like you, I have two sons that I love. Like you, I have a son in the audience 
today. This question is not meant to be disrespectful — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Sounds like it’s going to be, but go ahead. (Laughter) 
DOUG KASS: — but it’s a question I have to ask. 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. 
DOUG KASS: Someday your son, Howard, will become Berkshire’s nonexecutive chairman. 
Berkshire is a very complex business, growing more complex as the years pass. Howard has 
never run a diversified business, nor is he an expert on enterprise risk management. 
Best as we know, he hasn’t made material stock investments, nor has he ever been engaged in 
taking over a large company. 
Away from the accident of birth, how is Howard the most qualified person to take on this role? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, he’s not taking on the role that you described. He is taking on the role 
of being nonexecutive chairman in case a mistake is made in terms of who is picked as a CEO. 
I don’t — I think the probabilities of a mistake being made are less than 1 in 100, but they’re 
not 0 in 100. And I’ve seen that mistake made in other businesses. 
So it is not his job to run the business, to allocate capital, do anything else. If a mistake is made 
in picking a CEO, having a nonexecutive chairman who cares enormously about preserving the 
culture and taking care of the shareholders of Berkshire, not running the business at all, it will 
be far easier to then make another change. 
And that — he is there as a protector of the culture, and he has got an enormous sense of 
responsibility about that, and he has no illusions about — at all — about running the business. 
He would have no interest in running the business. He won’t get paid for running the business. 
He won’t have to think about running the business. 
He’ll only have to think about whether the board and himself — but as a member of the board 
— but whether the board may need to change the CEO. 
And I have seen many times, really many times, over 60-plus years or — well, probably 55 years 
as a director — times when a mediocre CEO, likable, you know, not dishonest, but not the 
person who should run it, needs to be changed. 
And it’s very, very hard to do when that person is in the chairman’s position. It’s not as — it’s a 
bit easier now that you have this procedure where the board meets at least once a year 
without the chairman present. 
That’s a very big improvement, in my view, in corporate America. Because it — a board is a 
social institution, and it is not easy for people to come in, we’ll say, to Chicago or New York or 
Los Angeles once every three months, have a few committee meetings, and maybe have some 
doubts about whether they’ve really got the right person running it. 
They may have a very nice person running it, but they could do better. But who’s going to make 
a change? 
And that’s the position that the nonexecutive chairman, in this case, Howard, will be in. And I 
know of nobody that will feel that responsibility more in terms of doing that job as it should be 
done than my son, Howard, you know. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. I think the Mungers are much safer — (applause) with Howard there. 
You’ve got to remember, the board owns a lot of stock, you know. We’re thinking about the 
shareholders. We’re not trying to gum it up for the shareholders. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. After my death, whatever it may be in terms of value then, but it 
would be $50 billion worth of stock, will, over a period of time, go to help people around the 
world and it makes an enormous difference, you know, whether the company behind that stock 
is doing well or not. 
And both Charlie and I have seen — we’ve seen some — more than one example — of where a 
CEO who might be a six on a scale of 10, and is perfectly likable and has, perhaps, helped select 
some of the directors that sit there, and continues to run the business year after year when 
somebody else could do it a whole lot better. 
And it can be hard to make that — very hard — to make that change if that person controls the 
agenda and, you know, keeps everybody busy when they come into town for a little while. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: You can have a CEO that’s nine out of 10 on everything but with deep flaws, 
too. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: It helps to have some objective person with a real incentive sitting in the 
position Howard will be in. 
WARREN BUFFETT: The example I’ve used in the past, I mean, that — you know, that blessed 
are the meek for they shall inherit the earth, but after they inherit the earth, will they stay 
meek? 
Well, that could be the problem, you know, if somebody got named CEO of Berkshire. It could 
be a position where people might want to throw their weight around in various ways. 
You may have noticed that in the annual report, in terms of our newspapers, I said, you know, I 
am not going to be telling them who to endorse for president. Ten of them endorsed Romney 
and two endorsed Obama. I voted for Obama, but I’m not going to change that. 
But when I write that sort of thing, I’m trying to box in my successor, to some degree, too, and 
we do not want somebody using Berkshire Hathaway as a power base in the future. We want 
them to be thinking about the shareholders. It’s that simple. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Sometimes somebody becomes CEO who has the characteristic of a once-
famous California CEO, and they used to say about him he’s the only man who could strut 
sitting down. (Laughter) 
21. Near-zero rates “brutal” for bonds 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 7. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. I’m Brad Johnston from Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
And my question is within the context of a very low interest rate environment that may be 
sustained for some time and the challenge that insurance companies are facing in that 
environment with respect to managing their capital, as well as managing their risk and 
uncertainty when they have future liabilities and potentially the need for liquidity. 
And maybe you could transcend that down to the individual, as well, who is dealing with a low 
interest rate environment, trying to manage uncertainty and yet still get some cash return from 
investments. 
I appreciate your concept of selling, you know, some of your shares periodically and being 
better off to do that rather than take dividends, but many people are dealing with the 
challenges of cash flow. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And then — and just one final tag-on. If you could at the end, could you 
explain what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke believes he has as a tool in his toolbox 
called the “term credit facility”? 
WARREN BUFFETT: No. The answer is I can’t. Can you, Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. 
WARREN BUFFETT: The problem faced by people who have stayed in cash, or cash equivalents, 
or short-term Treasurys, or whatever, I mean, it is brutal. 
The loss — if they live off their income, you know — the loss of purchasing power, it’s just 
staggering when you get into these low interest rates. They are huge victims of a low-interest 
policy and a dramatically low-interest policy, you know. 
Basically, you know, I’ve written — I wrote back in 2008 to own equities. I mean, it was — 
equities were cheap. 
And you were almost certain to get killed, you know, in terms of — for at least a while — we 
had a promise that the Fed was going to hold rates very low, so it was a great time to own 
equities. 
And I feel sorry for people that have clung to fixed-dollar investments, particularly short-term 
ones, during a period like this, and I don’t know what I would do if I were in that position. 
Imagine having, you know, some sum that seemed like a very large amount of money in the 
past but, you know, a quarter of a percent on a million dollars is $2,500 a year, and that is not 
what people anticipated when they were saving over the years. 
So I — well, anybody I’ve advised, I’ve always felt that owning businesses certainly made sense 
— more sense — than fixed dollars, under most circumstances. 
Not every time in my life, but probably 90 percent of the time in my life, it’s made more sense 
than owning fixed-dollar investments. And it’s certainly made dramatic sense a few years ago 
when equities were marked down to where they were, you know, terrific buys, and where you 
could see the prospect that fixed-dollar investments were going to pay very little for a 
considerable period of time. 
And I didn’t anticipate that we would see the kind of rates for the extended period that we 
have already, and I don’t know how long it will go on. 
But it’s a real dilemma for people. I get letters — I get a lot of letters — from people that say, 
you know, “I’ve got $300,000,” and they say, “What should I do?” 
So it’s — the fallout from low interest rates has hit millions of people in a very harsh way. And 
you don’t read much about it and they don’t have much of a voice, but it’s been a good 
argument for owning productive assets rather than dollars during a period like this. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they had to hurt somebody, and the savers were convenient. 
WARREN BUFFETT: What would you do about it? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I would’ve done about what they did. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, so would I. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I would’ve felt bad about it, but I would have — that’s what I would have 
done. 
22. IBM’s competitive moat 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 8. We’re now going to the shareholder base. We’ve gone 
through the panels, and we’ve got about 45 minutes left and so we’re going to give the 
shareholders a chance to ask — answer — to ask all the questions — maybe answer them — 
ask all the questions from this point. 
Station 8. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. Chris Hu (PH) from Tokyo, Japan. 
Can you talk a little bit more about the IBM investment? Where do you see the moat for that 
business? And just in the spirit of full disclosure, I work for Microsoft. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Was your — what was your — the moat about which business? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: IBM. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, IBM. Well, I would say that I do not understand the moat around an 
IBM as well as I understand the mode around a Coca-Cola. I think I have some understanding of 
it, but I feel I would have more conviction about the moat around a Coca-Cola, or a Wrigley or a 
Heinz, for that matter, than an IBM. 
But I feel good enough about IBM that we’ve put a considerable amount of money in it. And 
there’s nothing that precludes both Microsoft, which you mentioned, and IBM being successful. 
In fact, I hope they both are. 
We — I’ve got enough conviction about IBM’s position that we took a very large position. 
I like their financial policies. I think the odds are good that their position is maintained in a 
strong way over time, but I don’t feel the same degree of conviction about that as I do about 
the BNSF railroad. I mean, you know, it’s very hard for me to think of anything that could go 
wrong with BNSF. I could think of some things that could go wrong with IBM. 
They, incidentally, have a very large pension obligation. Now, they have a large pension fund, 
too, but you’re talking 75 or $80 billion of assets and liabilities that, you know, is a big — it is a 
big annuity company on the side. 
And you can have — balls can take funny bounces in the annuity field. I would rather they 
didn’t have that, but that is a fact that I take into consideration when I buy. They show the 
assets and liabilities of being roughly equal, but the liabilities are a lot more certain than the 
assets over time. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. Well, at least the IBM pension plan has the resources of IBM. Suppose 
you’re a big life insurance company now. All over the world, the life insurance companies have 
started to suffer the tortures of hell. 
In Japan, they agreed to pay 3 percent interest, and, of course, there was no way to earn 3 
percent interest once the Japanese policies had been in place a long time. 
A whole lot of once revered, secure places look unsecure now. 
And around Berkshire, you’ll notice the life operations are — where we have our own policies 
as distinguished from reinsurance — are pretty small, right? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. We do not like giving options in this world, and people tend to — 
well, particularly they’ve got a sales force pushing them on, as you have in the life insurance 
industry. They have tended to give people options that have, in certain cases, cost them huge 
amounts of money. 
It’s — you know, you always want to accept an option; you never want to give an option. But 
the life business is in just the reverse side of that. 
Actually, the mortgage business — I mean, you know, Charlie and I were in the savings and loan 
business. The idea of giving somebody a 30-year mortgage where they can — if it’s a good deal 
for you — they can call it off tomorrow, and if it’s a good deal for them, they keep it for 30 
years. 
Those are terrible instruments. They’re good for you if you’re buying a house, and I recommend 
that you — I recommend everybody in this room get a 30-year mortgage immediately on a 
house for all they can. 
If it’s a bad deal and rates go to 1 percent, you can refund it. If rates go to 6 or 7 percent, 
maybe you can buy it back for 70 cents on the dollar or something of the sort. 
So the life companies have engaged in that big time — big, big time — in the last few decades, 
and a lot of them are paying the price, and some of them haven’t even realized exactly quite 
what the problems are. 
They’re kind of like the fellow in the switchblade fight, you know, where the other guy takes a 
big swipe at him with a switchblade and the fellow says, “You didn’t touch me,” and the other 
guy says, “Well, just wait until you try and shake your head.” Well, that’s a little bit like where 
some of the life companies are right now. 
Charlie? Anything further, Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No, that’s gloomy enough. 
23. Investing with much smaller amounts of money 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 9. (Laughter) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. My name is Masato Muso. I’m from Los Angeles, California, and an 
MBA student at Boston University. 
You have mentioned that you are 85 percent Benjamin Graham and 15 percent Phil Fisher, and 
you have also said that if you only had $1 million today, you could generate 50 percent returns. 
Since I’m a young investor, this is my question for the both of you: how was your investment 
strategy different when you were still accumulating money as opposed to managing billions? 
Did you focus on specific industries, small cap, large cap, et cetera? Thank you. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, managing a million dollars is an entirely different game than running 
Berkshire Hathaway, or running some 20 or $50 billion fund of money. 
And if Charlie and I were running a million dollars now or 100,000 or — we would be looking in 
some — we’d be looking at some — probably some very small things. We would be looking for 
small discrepancies in certain situations. 
And the opportunities are out there, and periodically, they’re extraordinary. 
But that’s something we really don’t think about anymore because our problem is handling 12 
or 14 billion, or whatever it might be, coming in every year, and that means we have to be 
looking for very big deals and forget about what we used to do when we were very young. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. I’m glad I’m through with that particular problem. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: He worked pretty hard at it when — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. 
WARREN BUFFETT: We both did. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Did we ever. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, yeah. We looked under a lot of rocks, and — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I used to make big returns on my float on my own income taxes. Between 
the time I got the money and I paid it to the government, I frequently made enough money to 
pay the tax. It was working for small amounts of money and doing it on most things. 
WARREN BUFFETT: He didn’t tell me how to do it, though. (Laughs) 
24. Don’t invest in countries or categories 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 10. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Warren and Charlie. This is Andy Ling (PH) from Shanghai, China. 
Thank you very much for what you have said and what you have done. People around the globe 
have benefited a lot from your philosophies, so you have fans — even a lot of fans — even in 
China. 
My question is: how did you see investments in emerging markets where Berkshire is spend its 
investments in places like China? If yes, what kind of industries and companies you are 
interested in? Thank you. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. We don’t really start out looking to either emerging markets or 
specific countries or anything of the sort. 
We may find things, you know, as we go around, but it isn’t like Charlie and I talk in the morning 
and we say, you know, it’s a particularly good idea to invest in Brazil or India or China or 
whatever it may be. We’ve never had a conversation like that, have we, Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. 
WARREN BUFFETT: It just won’t happen. 
We don’t think that’s where our strength is. We know that our strength is not there. And we 
think, probably, most people’s strength isn’t there either. I mean, it sounds good, but I don’t 
really think it’s the best way to look at investments. 
If you told me that we can only invest — 
We’re perfectly willing to do it. We owned a lot of PetroChina at one time. We own some BYD 
now. We’ve owned securities outside the United States and will continue to. 
But if you told us that we could only invest in the United States the rest of our lives, we would 
not regard that as a huge hardship, would we, Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. It’s a great way to sell investment advice, to have a whole lot of 
different categories, lots of commissions, lots of advice, lots of action. 
And a lot of things we just — we don’t feel we’ve got enough of an edge so that we want to 
play. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. When we hear somebody talking concepts, of any sort, including 
country-by-country concepts or whatever it might be, we tend to think that they’re probably 
going to do better at selling than at investing. 
It’s just such an easy way — I mean, it’s what people expect to hear when — you know, when 
somebody comes calling that, you know, today we think you ought to be looking at this or that 
around the world. 
The thing to do is just find a good business at an attractive price and buy it. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Our experts really like Bolivia. And you say, “Well, last year you liked Sri 
Lanka.” It’s just — we’re not comfortable with that. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. And we usually think it’s a lot of baloney, but — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s why we’re not comfortable. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. (Laughter) 
25. Washington not solely to blame for housing bubble 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 11. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello, Mr. Buffett, and Mr. Munger. My name is Brandt Hooker from Los 
Angeles. 
I want to thank you both, first of all, for all the years of advice and your financial philanthropy, 
as well as your education and/or knowledge philanthropy you’ve given to so many investors 
around the world. 
And my question is: the U.S. government was seemingly complicit in enticing the American 
public to buy a home, and, therefore, a mortgage, at any cost. Do you think our legislators are 
doing the same thing now, and are we creating a bubble? 
WARREN BUFFETT: No. I don’t think we’re remotely near a bubble, in terms of housing, now. 
And I certainly think that your statement is accurate but not complete, in terms of what went 
on before. 
I mean, the whole country, almost, every — really kind of went crazy in terms of housing. And 
the government was a very big part of it because they’re a very big part of the financing of it. 
And it’s certainly true that plenty of legislators were encouraging Freddie and Fannie to be 
doing things that they shouldn’t have been doing, not just in retrospect. I mean, if you looked at 
it at the time, you could come to that conclusion. 
But there were an awful lot of people doing the same thing. I mean, it was coming from all 
sources. And it had that aspect to it, which bubbles do, where year after year for three or four 
or five years, whatever it might be, that the skeptics looked like idiots and that the people who 
jumped on the bandwagon were the ones that were refinancing their houses at ever higher 
prices and people who were speculating on other houses. 
So it just looked all so wonderful. And people are really susceptible to that sort of bandwagon 
effect where they see their neighbors making easy money, everybody’s making easy money but 
them, and they finally succumb. 
It’s just — it’s the nature of things. And it doesn’t mean the people at Freddie or Fannie were 
necessarily evil — a few of them were — or that legislators, necessarily, were evil, although, 
again, a few of them probably were. But overwhelmingly, I think most people just get caught up 
in a grand illusion. 
And, you know, it’s happened many times in history, it’ll happen again, and you can use that 
very much to your profit. 
We’re not in that kind of a period now on housing. You’ve got very, very low interest rates, 
which support, in many cases, the purchase of houses, because it brings down the payments, 
obviously. 
But I personally, about a year ago, I mean, I recommended to people that they buy houses, and 
I certainly recommend to people that they finance them now. 
And most places I would recommend if you find a — if you’re going to live in the community for 
some time and you find a house that fits your needs, I think it’s probably a very good time to 
buy it, in part because the financing is so unbelievably attractive. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, the main problem was that as things got crazier and crazier, the 
government could’ve intervened by pulling away the punch bowl before everybody was totally 
drunk, and instead, the government increased the proof. 
And this was not a good idea. But you — it’s hard to get governments in a democracy to be 
pulling away the punch bowl from voters who want to get drunk. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it’s almost impossible. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. I mean, it isn’t — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: So you’re complaining a little bit about what’s sort of inevitable in life. Not 
too good an idea. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. You’ll see it again, not necessarily in housing, but you will see it. 
And humans will continue to make the same mistakes that they have made in the past. 
I mean, they get fearful when other people are fearful. I mean, that’s — you saw it in those 
money market funds when 175 billion, you know, flowed out in three days. I mean, everybody 
gets — when people get scared, you know, they — it’s very, very pervasive. 
I’ve often thought that, you know, if I owned a bank in a two-bank town, you know, I’d — if I 
were inclined to — I might hire a whole bunch of Hollywood extras to form a line in front of the 
other guy’s bank. (Laughter) 
The hell of it is that they — you know, as soon as they got through forming a line there, they’d 
start forming a line at my bank because they — people really get — they get fearful en masse. 
Confidence comes back sort of one at a time, but when they get greedy, they get greedy en 
masse, too. 
I mean, it just — it’s just the way the humans are constructed. That’s where Charlie and I have 
an edge. We don’t have an edge, particularly, in many other ways. 
But we are able, I think, perhaps better than most, to not really get caught up with what other 
people are doing. And, you know, I don’t know whether we learned that over time or what. 
But when we see falling prices, you know, we think it’s an opportunity to buy, and it doesn’t 
bother us. 
Now, we don’t own things on margin or, you know, we don’t get ourselves in a position where 
somebody else can pull the rug out from under us. That’s enormously important in life. You 
never want to, you know, get out on a limb. 
And, of course, leverage gets very tempting when things are going up. And leverage was what 
was introduced into housing in a huge, huge way. I mean, people just felt that you were an idiot 
if you didn’t keep borrowing more on your house, and using that to buy more houses, or using 
it to live on, or whatever, and then finally the roof fell in. 
Charlie? 
26. Ready to invest in Europe despite its debt problems 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 1. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, Warren. Hi, Charlie. My name is George Islets (PH) from Cologne. 
Do you see investment opportunities in the eurozone? For example, extending your stake in 
Munich Re? 
Do you trust in the policy of the ECB to bring the things together? Thank you. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, we’re perfectly willing to look at business opportunity in the 
eurozone, and we bought a couple of bolt-on acquisitions, one for a couple hundred million in 
the farm equipment area. And we’ll be happy if we find a business in any one of the 17 
countries tied to the euro. 
There might be a few of them we may be a little less inclined than others. (Laughs) 
But — you know, it may create opportunities for us to buy businesses. We’d be happy to. 
Europe is not going to go away. But the European monetary union was — you know, had a 
major flaw, and they’re grappling with a way to correct that flaw. 
And with 17 political bodies and a lot of diverse cultures, it’s really tough for them to do so. 
They’ll do it in time, in my view. But essentially they synchronized a currency without 
synchronizing much else. 
And nature finds the fatal flaw always, and so does economics, and they found it fairly quickly, 
in terms of the euro. And the structure that was put in place will not work, and they’ll have to 
find something that does work. 
And they will, eventually, but they may go through a fair amount of pain in the process. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. Structured as Europe was structured, letting in Greece into the 
European Union was a lot like using rat poison as whipping cream. (Laughter) 
It just — it was an exceptionally stupid idea. (Laughter) 
It’s not a responsible capitalistic country, a place where people don’t pay taxes and so on and 
so — it just — and — 
WARREN BUFFETT: I’ve tried for years to get him to use ‘Country A’ and ‘Country B,’ but he — 
(Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: — and committed fairly extreme fraud in the course of getting into the 
union. They lied about their debt. 
And so Europe made terrible mistakes. They have politicians, too. (Laughter and applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: You think it’ll be behind them in ten years? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I think Europe will muddle through. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Sure. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Think what Europe has already muddled through. 
WARREN BUFFETT: But we would be delighted, even with that dire forecast, not overly — we 
would be delighted, tomorrow, to buy a big business in Europe that we liked, and we’d pay cash 
for it. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I hope you’ll call me if it’s in Greece. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: I make these small suggestions, but you can see it doesn’t help much. 
(Laughs) 
27. Social media will help some Berkshire businesses 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 2. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. I’m David Yarus (PH) from Miami Beach, Florida. 
On behalf of the internet, welcome to Twitter. 
And my question is: how has social media impacted your business and any Berkshire 
companies, and what impact do you see it having on the world in the short and long term? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Probably half the people or more in this audience could answer that 
question better than I can. 
It has — certainly in a place like GEICO, you know, we are — it makes a difference, and over 
time will make a huge difference in marketing, just as the internet made a change. 
I mean, GEICO was founded in 1936 and it had a great business idea of going direct, but it did it 
entirely by mail, initially, and it worked very well. 
And then it progressed to — as the world changed, it, you know, went to TV advertising and 
phone numbers and that sort of thing, and then it went to the internet, and now it goes on to 
social media. 
So, you know, we have to listen to our customers in all our businesses. Some of them it’s much 
more dramatic than others. 
And I’ve been amazed, you know, at how fast the world has changed. I thought the internet, for 
example, in terms of GEICO, would affect younger people very quickly, in terms of their buying 
habits. 
But the truth that it spread across the entire age range very, very quickly, a huge change. And 
you have to respond to that. And I am not the best person, by miles, to do that, but we have 
people that are very good at it at our businesses, and they’re thinking about it plenty, and 
they’ll continue to think about it. 
But it would be a terrible mistake to put me in charge of social media at Berkshire Hathaway. 
(Laughter) 
And Charlie would not be a particularly good choice, either. (Laughter) 
Charlie, do you want to defend yourself, or — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don’t understand it very well. For very good reason, I avoid it like the 
plague. 
And I hate the idea of the teenagers in my own family immortalizing for all time the three 
dumbest things they said when they were 13. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: We would have been in big trouble, Charlie. (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We would have been in big trouble, both of us, if that were the system. 
And so I think there’s a time when your ignorance and folly ought to be hidden. (Laughter and 
applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I also think that when you multitask like crazy, like the young people do, 
none of the tasks is likely to be done well. (Applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Is there anyone we’ve forgotten to offend? (Laughter) 
28. Frauds, crooks, and accounting 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 3. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. My name is Stuart Kaye (PH) and I work in Stamford, Connecticut. 
Earlier in the meeting, you said when reading over financial statements, you identified 
companies you were virtually certain were frauds. 
What was it in those financial statements that you saw that made you be so certain they were 
frauds? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it varies just enormously over the years, but there are — we can’t 
identify 100 percent of the frauds, or 90 percent, or 80 percent, but there are certain ones that 
jump out to you, just — people give themselves away a lot, too. 
I mean, in poker they talk about tells. And Charlie and I have bought a lot of businesses, and it’s 
very important when we buy those businesses that we assess the individuals that we’re buying 
from with some degree of accuracy. 
Because, you know, they hand us the stock certificate and we hand them a lot of money, and 
then we count on them to run the business with as much enthusiasm after they have the 
money as they did before. 
And so we are assessing people. And we don’t think we can assess everyone accurately. We just 
have to be right about the ones where we make an affirmative decision. 
And those decisions have not always been perfect, but they’ve been pretty good. And I would 
say they’ve probably gotten a little bit better, even, as the years have passed. 
Similarly, in looking at financial statements — for example, in the insurance field, we’ve seen 
some frauds, and they’re — you can see things being done with loss reserves occasionally. We 
saw it back in — I won’t name any names. Unlike Charlie, I don’t — we’ll call them Company As 
and Bs instead of naming names. 
But you would see companies that, when they were offering stock to the public, you know, the 
year or two before that, the reserves would be down very suspiciously, and — you know, then 
— or even when they were selling them to other insurance companies, if they were buying in 
stock they might be building the reserves. 
But there’s a million different ways. And I don’t claim I know all the ways, obviously, but I have 
seen enough situations over the years, and I’ve seen how promoters act. And you can spot 
certain people who you know are, one way or another, playing games with the numbers. They 
give themselves away. 
But I can’t give you a checklist of 40 items or something of the sort that you look for in the 
balance sheet or the income account or the footnotes. 
Charlie, can you help? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Sometimes it’s pretty obvious. I once was introduced by Warren, of all 
people, by accident, to a man who wanted to sell us a fire insurance company. One of the first 
things he said, with a thick accent, from Eastern Europe, I think — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Don’t name countries. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: And I don’t remember the country. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Good. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: But what he told me was — he says, “It’s like taking candy from babies,” he 
said. 
“We only write fire insurance on concrete structures that are underwater.” And I figured out 
instantly that it was probably fraudulent. 
WARREN BUFFETT: The guy’s a crook. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I’m a very acute man. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, the guy’s a crook. 
Well, you actually — you had some experience — you know, he was a lawyer in the movie 
industry. (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Oh, my God. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. The — when you get into accounting for — well, movies are a good 
thing, in terms of how fast you write off properties, and anything where you’ve got 
construction in progress or progress payment-type things — there’s so many ways you can 
cheat in accounting. 
And financial institutions are particularly, probably, prone to it. And there’s been plenty of it in 
insurance. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: A lot of it, they’re not being deliberately fraudulent, because they’re 
deluded. In other words, they believe what they’re saying. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. People like to hire them as salesmen. (Laughter) 
If you’ve got doubts, forget it. There’s probably some reason you — 
It’s interesting. The accounting — they worked harder and harder and harder at coming up with 
disclosures in accounting. And I’m not sure I find present financial statements more useful or, in 
some cases, as useful as I found them 30 or 40 years ago. (Scattered applause) 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think the financial statements of big banks are way harder to 
understand now than they used to be. They just do so many different things, and they’ve got so 
many footnotes, and there’s so much gobbledygook, that it doesn’t — they’re not my 
grandfather’s banks. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we couldn’t understand them when we owned them. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. 
WARREN BUFFETT: I mean, we bought a company that — Gen Re — where they had 23,000 
derivative contracts. And Charlie and I could’ve spent 24 hours a day, and had the help of 10 or 
20 math Ph.Ds. and we still wouldn’t have known what was going on. 
It cost us about $400 million to find out, but — and that was in a benign market. But nobody 
can. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: And the accountants had certified the balance sheet. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Sure. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: It’s a new kind of asset I invented a name for. I said, “Good until reached 
for.” (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, and you would — you would actually — the same auditing firm 
would be auditing two different companies that are on the opposite side of a derivative 
transaction and attesting to different values to the same contract. 
And Charlie found one mistake at Salomon on a derivative contract. What was it, 20 million? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. It was a big contract, and both sides reported a large profit, blessed by 
their accountants, on the same contract — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Kind of like us and Swiss Re. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: — just for breaking it. 
Once people get in a competitive frenzy, things just go out of control. 
WARREN BUFFETT: I became the interim chairman of — interim CEO — of Salomon in 1991, 
and, fortunately, I testified to both the House and Senate committee before I found this out. 
And, generally speaking, incidentally, Salomon wanted to have conservative accounting. I think 
that would be a fair statement. And in many cases did. 
But they did come in to me one day and they said, “Warren, you probably should know that we 
have this item” — and I think it was around 180 million or something like that — with a capital 
base of 4 billion, maybe — but 180 million. 
And they said, this is a plug number, and we’ve been plugging it ever since Phibro merged with 
Salomon in 19 — I guess, ’81. 
For ten years, this number moved around every day. And as I remember, Phibro or some — one 
of them was on a trade date system, and that was on a settlement date system. 
And in ten years, with Arthur Andersen as their accountant, paying a lot of money in auditing 
fees, they just never figured out how the hell to get the thing to balance, so they just stuck a 
number in every day. 
And they literally plugged it for ten years, and I couldn’t figure out how to unplug it myself. I 
mean, it was — you almost had to start over. Didn’t they do that one time out there? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We did that, Warren. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Right. (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We had a discrepancy when we changed accounting systems in our savings 
and loan, and none of the accountants could fix it. So we just let it run out. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we let the account — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We just let the account run out, and then — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Figured we’d start over again. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We started over, right. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Accounting is not quite the science that people might want you to — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: In accounting, you can do things like they do in Italy when they have trouble 
with the mail. You know, it piles up and irritates the postal employees. They just throw away a 
few carloads — (laughter) — everything flows smoothly thereafter. 
WARREN BUFFETT: You’re naming names again, folks. (Laughs) 
That happened in some unnamed international country. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, Italy. (Laughter) 
29. Would Berkshire invest in sub-Saharan Africa? 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Section 4. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. My name is Jerry Lucas (PH) from Newark, Delaware. 
You answered the question earlier about emerging markets. I just have a similar question. 
If you found the business that attracted you in sub-Saharan Africa, outside of South Africa, are 
the conditions right today to make that investment? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I might not know enough to do it myself, but I think — and I wouldn’t 
rule — if it was attractive enough and I thought I understood the nature of the business, I 
would probably get some advice from some other people. And I might not end up doing it, but I 
wouldn’t totally preclude it. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I saw that done. The University of Michigan hired an investment manager in 
London who specialized in sub-Saharan Africa. And I thought, “My God, how are they doing 
this?” 
What they did is the little banks would trade in the pink sheets in Africa, and the first thing 
people would want was not to have the money under their pillow, and they just bought all the 
little banks in Africa, and they made a lot of money. 
So it is possible, if you know what you’re doing, to go into very unlikely places. I would say 
we’re not very good at it. 
WARREN BUFFETT: No, that isn’t our specialty, but it can be done. And if we were poor enough, 
we might even be thinking about doing it, right, Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I don’t think so. 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. (Laughter) 
Next year we’ll prepare for this. (Laughter) 
30. Read over your will with your adult children 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 5. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. I’m Marvin Blum from Fort Worth, Texas, the home to four of your 
companies. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Absolutely. We love Fort Worth. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. We love you, too, and your presence in our community. 
I’m an estate planning lawyer, and it’s interesting as we wrap up today to ponder that the Baby 
Boomer generation is about to pass along the greatest transfer of wealth in history. 
I can design plans that eliminate estate tax and pass down great amounts of wealth to the next 
generation, but many of my clients come to me and say they want a plan like Warren Buffett’s, 
leaving their kids enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing. 
Now they ask me, and I’m asking you, how much is that, and how do you keep from ruining 
your kids? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well. 
(Applause) 
I think more kids are ruined by the behavior of their parents than by the amount of the 
inheritance. (Applause) 
Your children are learning about the world through you, and more through your actions than 
through your words, you know, from the moment they’re born. You’re their natural teacher, 
and, you know, it’s a very important and serious job. 
And I don’t think — I don’t actually think — that the amount of money that a rich person leaves 
to their children is the determining factor, at all, in terms of how those children turn out. But I 
think that the atmosphere, and what they see about them, and how their parents behave, is 
enormously important. 
I would say this: I’ve loosened up a little bit as I go along. 
Every time I rewrite my will, my kids are happy because they know I’m not reducing the 
amount, anyway. (Laughter) 
And I do something else that — I find that — which I think is an obvious thing, but it’s amazing 
to me how many don’t do it. 
I think that your children are going to read the will someday — that’s assuming you’re a 
wealthy person — your children are going the read the will someday. 
It’s crazy to have them read it after you’re dead, for the first time. I mean, you’re not in a 
position to answer questions then unless the Ouija board really works or something of the sort. 
So if they’re going to have questions about how to carry out your wishes, or why you did this or 
that, you know, why leave them endlessly wondering after you die? 
So in my own case, I always have my children — I rewrite a will every five or six years or 
something like that — and I have them read it. 
They’re the executors under it. They should understand how to carry out their obligations that 
are embodied in the will, and they should — also, if they feel there’s anything unfair about it, 
they should express themselves before I sign that will, and we should talk it over, and we 
should figure out whether they’re right or I’m right, or someplace in between. 
So I do think it’s very important in wealthy families, once the kids are of a certain age. I mean, I 
don’t advise doing this with your 14-year-old or something, but when they get — you know, 
certainly by the time they’re in the mid-30s or thereabouts — I think they should be 
participants in the will. 
And I do think that if you get to be very wealthy that the idea of trying to pass on, create a 
dynasty of sorts, it just sort of runs against the grain, as far as I’m concerned. 
And the money has far more utility — you know, the last hundreds of millions or billions have 
far more utility to society than they would have to make — create a situation — where your 
kids don’t have to do anything in life except call a trust officer once a year and tell them how 
much money they want. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I don’t think I want to go into this one. 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: And I’m absolutely sure you don’t want to discuss your will with your 
children if you’re going to treat them unequally. 
WARREN BUFFETT: No. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: That is poison. 
WARREN BUFFETT: But there — one of the problems you have — I mean, and what you want to 
discuss just for that very situation is there may be circumstances where one child will have 
much more of an interest in one type of asset than others, or something of the sort. 
And you want to make sure that your definition of equality, in terms of handling different kinds 
of assets, meshes, or at least is understood, by the children so that they don’t think the fact 
that you may gave one a farm and another a house or something of the sort resulted in 
inequality when you thought it was equality. 
Charlie, you got anything? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. I’m — 
WARREN BUFFETT: He’s staying away from this one. 
31. No question from station 6 — Buffett’s happy 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Station 6. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: No question. 
WARREN BUFFETT: No questions. I like station six. (Laughter) 
32. Don’t hold your breath until … 
WARREN BUFFETT: Station 7. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, thanks for everything that you do for us, 
including advice that you give us, and also for — as an individual investor — for the things that 
you’ve done for me. 
I have a question. You’ve long been against stock splits, but as you think about the Berkshire A 
share and one day can — if you don’t split it — it can get to a million dollars, is the board 
thinking about how to deal with that, in terms of getting new stock owners, the ownership 
structure, and so on? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I — we actually — I think we’ve got a pretty good arrangement now. 
It evolved, originally, through some people that were going to try and make a lot of money off 
of our shareholders by creating their own split shares, so we created the B shares. 
And then when the BNSF acquisition came along, we wanted to be sure that people that 
wanted to have a stock-free exchange, or that wanted to get shares, would not prohibit it 
simply because they had a small amount of BNSF, and, therefore, our B shares were too 
expensive. 
So I think now with one stock, you know, in the $100 range, people can split the — people that 
own the A stock can split their stock anytime they wish. 
And we’ve always pledged that there won’t ever be this situation, but if there was some 
corporate transaction or anything like that, we will — the A and B will get treated identically. 
And so I really see no reason to change the present situation. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I would not hold your breath until we change. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: That may apply to almost anything in our lives.
