Afternoon Session - 1996 Meeting 
1. Investing with “the two wealthiest guys” 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK, if we’ve got a monitor over in zone 1, we’re ready to start. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. Thank you very much. My name is Maria Nicholas Kelly (PH). I’m from 
Tacoma, Washington. 
And my husband and I have rather different investment approaches. And in 1988, he bought 
me one share of Berkshire, so that I could learn something about investing. We both started 
about that same time. 
And he has chosen to invest in, let’s say, about 40 different stocks and buying and selling, and 
doing rather well for us, frankly. 
My approach is more simple. And basically, I finally figured out last year that I should invest in 
the companies of the two wealthiest men in the world. 
So — (laughter) — I decided we should buy, monthly, more Berkshire and Microsoft. So, then 
this year — and so, we’ve been able to do that. 
This year, we read in your report that Berkshire is selling “at a price at which Charlie and I 
would not consider buying it,” so my husband has challenged my investment strategy. 
(Laughter) 
I know that you are an honest man. And while you may not — (laughter) — you may not 
recommend to “my partner, Charlie,” to buy more Berkshire at this time, do you recommend 
that I continue — (Buffett laughs) — my rather automatic investment buying of Berkshire? 
And I wanted — I think I know the answer. But I wanted my husband to hear it from the horse’s 
mouth. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: I think you’re using me here. (Laughter) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I — we don’t recommend selling it, but we don’t recommend buying 
it, either. We are neutral on that subject. 
And I hope you continue to be in with the two wealthiest guys. I like the other fellow, too. 
(Laughter) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. 
2. American Express has “slipped” in credit cards 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett, I am Harriet Morton from the Emerald City [Seattle], the same 
area, the land of Microsoft. And I have a couple small questions. 
The first one is, recognizing your lack of interest in technology or sense of familiarity with it, I’m 
wondering if you’d give a few comments on Bill Gates as a manager. 
But the second one, dealing with a business that you’re familiar with, has to do with American 
Express. 
Would you comment on American Express’ strategy to deal with their declining market share in 
the credit card industry and the rising importance of debit cards? Thank you. 
WARREN BUFFETT: I’m not sure I got that entirely, Charlie. Did you? I mean, I got the part about 
American — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: She wanted you to comment on Gates as a manager and American Express 
as — with the problems in declining in market share. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, the first part is very easy. You know, Bill Gates is, you know, one of the 
great managers of all time and is an exceptional business talent who loves his business. 
And when you get that combination and a high energy level and, now, an heir to leave it to, I 
don’t think you do much better than that. 
American Express has, you know — has slipped over from where they were 20 years ago, 
obviously, in the credit card business. And I think they may have taken their customer a little bit 
for granted for a while. 
I think [CEO] Harvey Golub is very focused on correcting that and has made some progress. But 
the credit card business is a very different competitive struggle now than it was 20 or 25 years 
ago. 
Interestingly enough, American Express, itself, backed into the business. Because they were 
worried about what was going to happen to their traveler’s check business, originally. 
And they saw Diners Club come along. A fellow named Ralph Schneider and — started it. And 
they saw the inroads that were being made. So, the credit card was a reactive move. And for a 
while, they really dominated the field. And of course, they still dominate the travel and 
entertainment part of it. 
But credit cards are going to be a very competitive business over time. And you need to 
establish — American Express needs to establish — special value for its card in some way, or it 
gets more commodity-like. 
It’s not an easy business. But their franchise — they’ve got a strong franchise. It is not what it 
was 20 years ago, relative to the competition. 
3. “A lot of mediocrity” among CEOs 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 3? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. My name is John Weaver. I’m a shareholder from 
Bellingham, Washington. 
You have discussed what a wonderful business is. One of the criterias in your acquisition, page 
23 of your annual report, is management. 
Could you discuss how you decide what good management is and how you decide whether you 
have a good manager? 
WARREN BUFFETT: The really great business is one that doesn’t require good management. I 
mean, that is a terrific business. And the poor business is one that can only succeed, or even 
survive, with great management. And — 
But we look for people that know their businesses, love their businesses, love their 
shareholders, want to treat them as partners. And we still look to the underlying business, 
though. We — 
If we have somebody that we think is extraordinary, but they’re locked into one of those 
terrible businesses, because we’ve been in some terrible businesses, and you know, the best 
thing you can do, probably, is get out of it and get into something else. 
But there’s an enormous difference, frankly — there’s an enormous difference in the talent of 
American business managers. 
The CEOs of the Fortune 500 are not selected like 500 members of the American Olympic track 
and field team. And it is not the same process. And you do not have the uniformity of top 
quality that you get with the American Olympic team in any sport. You do not get that in top 
management in American business. 
You get some very able people, some terrific people, like a Bill Gates, that we just mentioned. 
But you get a lot of mediocrity, too. 
And the test — I think, in some cases, that it’s fairly identifiable, who has done an extraordinary 
job. And we like people that have batted .350 or .360, in terms of predicting that they’re going 
to bat over .300 in the future. 
And some guy says, you know, “I batted .127 last year. But I’ve got a new bat or a new batting 
coach,” you know, some management consultant has come in and told them how to do it, 
supposedly. 
We’re very suspicious of that. So we don’t like banjo hitters who suddenly proclaim that they 
can become power hitters. 
And then we try to figure out what their attitude is toward shareholders. And that isn’t uniform, 
either, throughout corporate America. It’s far from uniform. 
We still want them to be in a good business, though. I would emphasize that. 
We feel that — I mean, I gave the illustration of Tom Murphy in the annual report. 
I mean, no one had either the ability — no one could top his ability or integrity, in terms of the 
way he ran Cap Cities for decades. I mean, and you could see it in 50 different ways. 
I mean, he was thinking about the shareholders. And he not only thought about them, he knew 
what to do to forward their interests, and — 
In terms of building the business, he only built it when it made sense, not when it did 
something for his ego or to make it larger alone. He did it when it was in his shareholders’ 
interests. 
And they’re not all Tom Murphys. But when you find them, and they’re in a decent business, 
you want to bet very heavily and not make the same mistake I made by selling out once or 
twice, too. (Laughter) 
4. “Diversification is a protection against ignorance” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone — was that zone 3 or —? Yeah, zone 4. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, my name is Mark Hake (PH). I’m from Scottsdale, Arizona. 
And I am very interested in your policies on diversification and also how you concentrate your 
investments. 
And I’ve studied your annual reports going back a good number of years, and there’s been 
years where you had a lot of stocks in your marketable, equitable securities portfolio. And there 
was one year where you only had three, in 1987. 
So, I have two questions. Given the number of stocks that you have in the portfolio now, what 
does that imply about your view of the market in terms of, is it fairly valued, that kind of idea? 
And second of all, whenever you — it seems that, whenever you take a new investment, you 
never take less than about 5 percent and never more than about 10 percent of the total 
portfolio with that new position. And I wanted to see if I’m correct about that. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, on the second point, that really isn’t correct. 
We have positions which you don’t even see, because we only listed the ones above 600 million 
in the last report. And obviously, those are all smaller positions. 
Sometimes, that’s because they’re smaller companies, and we couldn’t get that much money 
in. Sometimes, it’s because the prices moved up after we’d bought them. Sometimes, it’s 
because we may be selling the position down, even. So there’s nothing magic. 
We like to put a lot of money in things that we feel strongly about. And that gets back to the 
diversification question. 
You know, we think diversification is — as practiced generally — makes very little sense for 
anyone that knows what they’re doing. 
Diversification is a protection against ignorance. 
I mean, if you want to make sure — (laughter) — that nothing bad happens to you relative to 
the market, you own everything. There’s nothing wrong with that. I mean, that is a perfectly 
sound approach for somebody who does not feel they know how to analyze businesses. 
If you know how to analyze businesses and value businesses, it’s crazy to own 50 stocks or 40 
stocks or 30 stocks, probably, because there aren’t that many wonderful businesses that are 
understandable to a single human being, in all likelihood. 
And to have some super-wonderful business and then put money in number 30 or 35 on your 
list of attractiveness and forego putting more money into number one, just strikes Charlie and 
me as madness. 
And it’s conventional practice, and it may — you know, if you all you have to achieve is average, 
it may preserve your job. But it’s a confession, in our view, that you don’t really understand the 
businesses that you own. 
You know, I base — on a personal portfolio basis — you know, I own one stock. But it’s a 
business I know. And it leaves me very comfortable. (Laughter) 
So you know, do I need to own 28 stocks, you know, to have proper diversification, you know? 
It’d be nonsense. 
And within Berkshire, I could pick out three of our businesses. And I would be very happy if they 
were the only businesses we owned, and I had all my money in Berkshire. 
Now, I love it — the fact that we can find more than that, and that we keep adding to it. But 
three wonderful businesses is more than you need in this life to do very well. 
And the average person isn’t going to run into that. I mean, if you look at how the fortunes 
were built in this country, they weren’t built out of a portfolio of 50 companies. They were built 
by someone who identified with a wonderful business. Coca-Cola’s a great example. A lot of 
fortunes have been built on that. 
And there aren’t 50 Coca-Colas. You know, there aren’t 20. If there were, it’d be fine. We could 
all go out and diversify like crazy among that group and get results that would be equal to 
owning the really wonderful one. 
But you’re not going to find it. And the truth is, you don’t need it. I mean, if you had — a really 
wonderful business is very well protected against the vicissitudes of the economy over time and 
the competition. 
I mean, you know, we’re talking about businesses that are resistant to effective competition. 
And three of those will be better than 100 average businesses. 
And they’ll be safer, incidentally. I mean, there is less risk in owning three easy-to-identify, 
wonderful businesses than there is in owning 50 well-known, big businesses. And it’s amazing 
what has been taught, over the years, in finance classes about that. 
But I can assure you that I would rather pick — if I had to bet the next 30 years on the fortunes 
of my family that would be dependent upon the income from a given group of businesses, I 
would rather pick three businesses from those we own than own a diversified group of 50. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, what he’s saying is that much of what is taught in modern corporate 
finance courses is twaddle. (Laughter and applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: You want to elaborate on that, Charlie? (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: You cannot believe this stuff. I mean, it’s modern portfolio theory and — 
yeah, it’s — 
WARREN BUFFETT: It has no utility. But you know, it will tell you how to do average. But, you 
know, I think anybody can figure out how to do average in fifth grade. I mean, it’s just not that 
difficult, and — 
It’s elaborate. And you know, there’s lots of little Greek letters and all kinds of things to make 
you feel that you’re in the big leagues. But it — (laughter) — there is no value added. (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I have great difficulty with it because I am something of a student of 
dementia — (laughter) — and I have — 
WARREN BUFFETT: And we hang around a lot together. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: And I get ordinarily — classified dementia, you know, on some theory, 
structure of models. But the modern portfolio theory, it involves a type of dementia I just can’t 
even classify. (Laughter) 
Something very strange is going on. (Buffett laughs) 
WARREN BUFFETT: If you find three wonderful businesses in your life, you’ll get very rich. And if 
you understand them — bad things aren’t going to happen to those three. I mean, that’s the 
characteristic of it. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: By the way, maybe that’s the reason there’s so much dementia. If you 
believed what Warren said, you could teach the whole course in about a week. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, and the high priests wouldn’t have any edge over the laypeople. And 
that never sells well. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Right. 
5. Downsizing is sometimes needed to correct excessive hiring in the past 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK, zone — what, 5, are we over there? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, board of directors. 
Wanted to ask, in looking ahead, do you see the trends of extensive outsizing, the offshoring, 
the downsizing, the expendable workforce, the rightsizing, the diminished commitment to 
company loyalty, and the greater emphasis on the short term, quick buck, bottom line versus 
your commitment to the long-term investment affecting your pool of investment possibilities 
and your decision processes? 
And do you possibly think of creating new companies on your own? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I think that the trends you talk about, and the attention devoted to 
them, could have some effect, just in terms of how the public and Congress may feel toward 
business. 
Historically, you know, every industry, at all times, is interested in downsizing or becoming 
more efficient. 
Now, if the industry is growing, you can achieve efficiency by doing more work, or turning out 
more output, with the same people. 
But you know, if you go back 150 years and look at the percentage of people in farming, for 
example, farming has downsized from being a very appreciable percentage of the American 
workforce to a very small percentage. And essentially, that’s released people to do other things. 
So, it’s in the interest of society to get as much output in anything as it can per unit of labor 
input. It’s very difficult on the individual involved. 
And you know, it’s no fun — I guess it’s no fun being a horse when the tractor comes along, or a 
blacksmith, and when the car comes along. But the — 
So, I don’t quarrel with the activities. I quarrel, sometimes, with how it’s done. And I do think 
there’s been a certain lack of, in certain cases, some empathy or sensitivity in terms of the way 
it’s being done. 
You should try to make your businesses more efficient. We hope we’re not in businesses that 
will require us to lay off people over time, because we hope that physical output grows, and 
that we become more productive and can keep the same number of people to get greater 
output. 
Dexter Shoe has done a great job of that over time. They’ve become more and more 
productive. But they’ve sold more shoes instead of selling the same number of shoes and 
letting people go. But sometimes, industry trends — 
I mean, at World Book, we have fewer people than we had a year or two ago. And we didn’t — 
we don’t have any answer to that. 
Over time, we got out of the textile business. I wish we didn’t have to. But we did not know 
how to run a textile company in New England and compete effectively. 
Like I say, I would — I love avoiding those businesses. And to the extent we can, we will. 
I mean, GEICO is going to add people over time. And I think Berkshire Hathaway’s going to add 
people over time. 
But I can’t — but it is in the interest of society to do jobs more effectively. It’s also in the 
interest of society, it seems to me, to take care, in some way, of the people that are affected by 
that activity. And either — in some cases, it may be retraining. 
But in other cases, you know, it doesn’t work so well if you’re 55 years old, and you’ve been 
working in a textile mill all your life, and all of a sudden the guy that runs the place can’t make 
any money out of selling your output. I mean, that’s not the fellow’s fault that’s been working 
at the textile mill for 30 years. 
So, there’s a balance in that. I think that the attention that’s come about lately, I think there’s 
— to some degree, it was a media fad based on some particularly dramatic examples at a 
couple of companies. 
I don’t think there is more displacement going on now, as a percentage of the labor force, 
annually, than there was 10 years ago, in terms of reconstituting what people do. But it’s gotten 
a lot of attention lately. 
There could be a backlash on that, in terms of corporate tax rates or a number of things. And 
we might feel it in that direction. 
We want, at Berkshire, to do everything as efficiently as we can. Part of that, in a big way, is not 
taking on a lot of people we don’t need. 
A lot of the mistakes that are being corrected now are because people got very fat. And their 
businesses got very fat in the past and took on all kinds of people they don’t need. We see that 
in a lot of businesses that we’re exposed to. 
And as long as they’re very prosperous, really, no one does very much about it. And then when 
the time comes, they all of a sudden find out they can get way more output. 
The oil companies are a classic example. You know, the people, probably, actually needed to 
produce, refine, and market oil probably hasn’t changed that much. But if you look at the 
employment relative to barrels produced, refined, and marketed, it’s gone down dramatically 
over 20 years ago. 
To me, it just means that they weren’t being run that well 20 years ago. And it never should’ve 
occurred in the first place. 
We don’t want to take on more people than we need in any of our businesses, because we 
don’t want to lay people off, either. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, if you put it in reverse, you’d say, name a business that has been 
ruined because it was over-downsized. I cannot think of a single one. 
But if you asked me to name businesses that were half-ruined, or ruined, by bloat, I mean, I 
could just rattle off name after name after name. 
It’s gotten fashionable to assume that downsizing is wrong. Well, it may have been wrong to let 
the business get so fat that it eventually had to downsize. 
But if you’ve got way more people than are needed in the business, I see no social benefit in 
having people sit around half employed or unemployed. 
WARREN BUFFETT: You’re very likely to compete against some guy, at some point, who doesn’t 
have more people around than needed in the business, too. But it doesn’t change. For the 
people involved, they’ve got real problems, and — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Warren, can you name one that has been ruined by over-downsizing? There 
must be one, but — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it’s like Eisenhower said about Nixon. Give me a week, and I’ll come 
up with something. (Laughter) 
6. No layoffs at insurance operations due to reduced volume 
WARREN BUFFETT: How about zone 6? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, I’m Walter Kaye of New York City. 
WARREN BUFFETT: We’re glad to have you here, Walter. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What? 
WARREN BUFFETT: We’re glad to have you here. Walter’s been a good friend of ours. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you very, very much. You just make me more of an egomaniac, a 
humble egomaniac, by saying that. 
I don’t know if Mr. Munger’s wife is here and Mrs. Buffett is here, but back East, where I come 
from, in New York, they say, “When people — when men are successful, it’s their wife’s doing. 
But if they’re a failure, it’s because they’re lazy.” (Laughter) 
But anyhow, I just wanted to, again, thank you very much. You’ve done such great things for 
our family. It’s absolutely incredible. 
And to those of you who don’t know these two gentlemen, besides being financial geniuses, 
and you all know Mr. Buffett and, somewhat, Mr. Munger, too, they’re the finest human beings 
you’ll ever meet. I mean, just the way they explained this downsizing is the most intelligent 
thing that I’ve ever heard. 
And eventually, like, you know, these people eventually find work. They have to be reeducated 
and everything like that. 
But one point of business I’d like to ask you, if you don’t mind. I have been noticing that there 
has been a tremendous amount of new capital going into reinsurance carriers. 
And I was wondering if you could make a few comments about that, if you think that will affect 
the reinsurance business — have any effect on the insurance business in general, because, as 
you know better than I, we’re still in a very soft market. 
And there isn’t a month that goes by that I don’t hear of some new reinsurance carrier, 
whether in Bermuda or London or somewhere. Thank you. 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Walter knows more about insurance than I do. But I’ll, nevertheless, 
comment on that. 
There has been a fair amount of capital. And there was a rush of it about, I’d say, maybe three 
years ago into the reinsurance business. 
But there has been capital come in, and that is negative for our business. I mean, because any 
capital that’s brought in, basically, will get employed. 
We are willing, at Berkshire — and we do it — we are willing to sit on the sidelines in the 
reinsurance business. 
We’ll offer quotes. But somebody that — will cut those prices substantially, if they’ve got a lot 
of capital and want to keep busy. And if you’ve got a lot of capital in this business, or if you 
attracted a lot of capital, you will do something. You might like to do something smart, but if 
need be, you’ll do something dumb. 
You’ll rationalize it, so you think it’s smart. But you will do it. You won’t just sit there and write 
the shareholders at the end of the year and say, you know, “We asked you for $300 million last 
year. And we’d like to report that it’s all safely in a bank account at Citicorp.” It just doesn’t 
work that way. 
So they will go out and do something. People don’t like to sit around all day and do nothing. 
And that means that prices will get cut under certain circumstances. And those circumstances 
— that’s happening now. 
We will — at Berkshire, we do have a rule about downsizing on that. We have promised people, 
at all of our insurance operations, that we will never have layoffs because of a drop in volume. 
We do not want the people who run our insurance business to feel they have to write X dollars 
in order to keep everybody there. 
We can afford some overhead around that’s costing us a little money for lack of using it at full 
capacity, because it isn’t that much, relative to the size of our insurance operation. 
What we can’t afford are people feeling some internal compulsion to keep writing business in 
order to keep their job. So, we have a strong policy on that. 
And if the business falls away, in terms of price, we won’t be doing business. But we will be 
around to do business in a big way when the circumstances reverse. 
They reversed in the casualty business for a while in 1985 or thereabouts. And we did a terrific 
amount of business. 
They reversed in catastrophe reinsurance four or five years ago, and we became very active in 
that, and — 
We will have times that are very good for us in insurance. It’s a lot like investments. If you feel 
you have to invest every day, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes. It just — it isn’t that kind 
of a business. You have to wait until you get the fat pitch. 
And in insurance, it’s similar. You do not — if we had a budget for premium volume for our 
insurance companies, it would be the dumbest thing we could do, because they would meet 
the budget. 
They could meet any budget I set out. I could tell some operation that wrote a hundred million 
last year to write 500 million this year, and they would meet it, you know, and I would be 
paying the bills for decades to come, so — 
It’s a very illogical way to try and plan 8 or 10 percent-a-year growth. 
Now, GEICO is a different story in that GEICO is a business that is the low-cost operator and can 
attract, from a huge pool, business at, I think, a very good rate of growth simply by letting 
people know what’s available out there. So that is a business that I see growing under almost 
any circumstances. 
But our reinsurance business will swing around enormously, in terms of volume, based on what 
the competitor is doing. And what the competitors are doing depends, to a great extent, on 
how much money they’ve got burning a hole in their pocket. 
And right now, it’s going one direction. But it will change, I mean, just like investment markets 
change, you know. I’ve been through at least a half a dozen periods where people think, you 
know, they’re never going to get a chance to buy securities at intelligent prices. And it always 
changes. 
In the insurance business, people that misprice their policies will pay the price for it. And the 
world will still need insurance. And we will still be there. 
7. International expansion for GEICO would be dangerous distraction 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 7? Oh, we don’t have any. I guess we have everybody in here now, so 
we’ll go back to zone 1. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett, salutations from Portugal. I am from Portugal. My name is 
Herculano Fortado (PH). I have been a shareholder of your company since it was traded on the 
NASDAQ. 
And I hold the shares and went on accumulating year after year, whenever funds were available 
and were at my disposal. 
Now, a little bit about my history. As a student, I am from India. I was born in India, of Indian 
parentage. And my parents were very modest and could not afford me higher education. I 
started my school — 
WARREN BUFFETT: I think maybe you’d better just get to the question, though, if you will, 
please. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. And then started writing insurance, life insurance, for a company 
which was a subsidiary of American Life. 
My question now is this. I am now living in Portugal, and I see that the European market is 
developing and Berkshire Hathaway is having a very big slice of insurance investments. 
They don’t seem to be operating in the new markets that are emerging in Europe, and as well 
as in countries like India or the Pacific area, where the human — two-thirds of human beings 
are living. 
Is there a policy or a plan, on the part of Berkshire Hathaway, to diversify and internationalize 
their insurance business? This is my only question. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Thank you. 
The reinsurance business of Berkshire Hathaway is totally international. I mean, we deal with 
risks all over the world. We deal with companies all over the world. 
And that’s the nature of the reinsurance business, generally, although there might be some that 
would be more specialized to this country, but — 
We are quite willing to take on risks around the world, although they have to be risks with a 
large premium. I mean, that’s the nature of our reinsurance business. We’re not in the retail 
end of the business. 
But we do that worldwide. And we’ll continue to do that worldwide, because there are huge 
risks that exist for primary insurers around the world. And they need somebody to lay them off 
on. 
Now, whether they will pay the proper price is another question. And it may be a little more 
difficult, in a few jurisdictions, to do business than in others. But that’s an international 
operation. 
GEICO has two-and-a-fraction percent of the U.S. auto market. We have about 2 1/2 million 
policyholders. There are over a hundred million in the country. 
And there is such an opportunity here that it would be diversionary to go into other countries 
with GEICO. 
There’s been a firm that was very successful over in England that introduced a somewhat 
GEICO-like operation about 10 years ago. And they did very well. They are now encountering 
more competition. And their results are falling off somewhat, but — 
There’s a huge potential for GEICO in this country. And I would not want the management of 
GEICO to be going off in other directions now, when there’s so much to be done here. 
I mean, three percentage points on our growth rate here, for example, you know, would be 75 
million or so of volume. And that, in turn, would keep compounding over time. Well that — 
there’s too much to do here before we set up some startup operation around the world. 
And there are actually various problems in a lot of jurisdictions in — to run a GEICO-like 
operation — although I wouldn’t say that that prevails every place. I mean, there could be 
opportunities. But the opportunity here in this country is huge. And the management of GEICO 
is focused. 
I love focused management. The management of — if you read the Coca-Cola annual report, 
you will not get the idea that Roberto Goizueta is thinking about a whole lot of things other 
than Coca-Cola. 
And I have seen that work time after time. And when they lose that focus — as, actually, did 
Coke and Gillette both, at one point 20 to 30 years ago somewhat — it shows up. 
I mean, it — two great organizations were not hitting their potential 20 years ago. And then 
they became refocused. And what a difference it makes. It makes tens of billions of dollars’ 
worth of difference, in terms of market value. 
GEICO actually started — they started fooling around in a number of things in the early ’80s, 
and they paid a price to do it. They paid a very big price. 
They paid a direct price, in terms of the cost of those things, because they almost all worked 
out badly. And then they paid an additional price in the loss of focus on the main business. 
That will not happen with the present management. Tony Nicely thinks about nothing else but 
doing — carrying the GEICO message to people who — that 97 1/2 percent or so that are not 
policyholders. And that will work very well for us over time. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We are indirectly in all of these emerging markets through Coca-Cola and 
Gillette. So, it isn’t true that we’re totally absent. 
WARREN BUFFETT: No. Well, at Coca-Cola the international markets are 80 percent of profits — 
actually, a little more. 
Gillette, I think they’re about 70 percent or so. So, the — we love the international aspects of 
the Coca-Cola or Gillette businesses. And that’s a very major attraction. 
But the management of those companies is focused on that. But they are doing — they have 
distribution systems, and they have recognition, and they’ve got a lot going for them over 
there. But the beauty of it is that they’re maximizing what they do have going for them, which 
was not the case 20 years ago. 
They just sort of let it go more by default, and they started fooling around with a lot of 
diversification. And you know, basically, that has not worked that well. So, we like focus. We 
love focus. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, and doing it indirectly, as we’ve done, one can argue that we, 
thereby, do it a lot better. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: We won’t explore the implications of that. (Laughter) 
8. Shareholders boost Borsheims sales 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name’s George Olson (PH). I’m from Atlanta, Georgia. I have a couple 
quick questions for you. 
First of all, I’d like to have your comments on the USAir preferred that were — they’re several 
quarters in arrears on. 
And secondly, I was wondering about the Borsheims report from yesterday. You usually 
comment on that. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, Susan Jacques, who runs Borsheims, called me this morning. And her 
voice was hoarse but happy, and — (Laughs) 
Borsheims — that comparable day last year was the biggest day of the year. And it was about 
60 percent up this year, so — I’m — you’ve done your part. (Applause) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: We are starting a new custom at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings. A 
shareholder came up to me and asked for my autograph on his sales slip from Borsheims — 
(laughter) — which was a $54,000 watch. 
Now, that is the kind of autographs we like to give. (Laughter and applause) 
And so our message to you all is, “Go thou and do likewise.” (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: It wasn’t a member of Charlie’s family, incidentally. (Laughter) 
9. USAir investment has improved, but was still a mistake 
WARREN BUFFETT: The USAir preferred, as I mentioned in the annual report, it looks 
considerably better than it did 18 months ago or thereabouts. 
But their fundamental problem — and Steve Wolf has said this — the new CEO of USAir — the 
fundamental problems are there. And they either address and correct those fundamental 
problems, or those problems will address and correct them. (Laughter) 
And the — you know, their costs are out of line. Their costs are those that are relics of a 
regulated, protected environment. And they are not in a regulated, protected environment. 
And so far, they have not had any great success in correcting the situation. 
Knowing Mr. Wolf, I’m sure he is, you know, focused entirely on getting that changed. And he 
will need to get it changed. And he — his record has been pretty successful at that. 
So, we’re a lot better off with our US Air preferred than we were 18 months ago, but it still is a 
mistake I made. 
And we would’ve been a lot better off if I’d just, as Charlie says, gone out to a bar that night 
instead. (Laughter) 
You got any comments, Charlie, on USAir? He doesn’t want to comment. It may sound like it’s 
his deal. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: It’s, plainly, worth a lot more than it was last year. (Laughter) 
10. Newspapers may evolve, but won’t disappear entirely 
WARREN BUFFETT: And with that, we’ll move to zone 3. (Laughter) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, David Winters, Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. 
Without ruining my fun, can you give me a few hints about how I should think about calculating 
the intrinsic value — (Buffett laughs) — of the insurance businesses? 
And secondly, I’m wondering about, not that you can foretell the future, either one of you, but 
with regards to newspapers, is there any concern that it goes the way of the printed World 
Book and Blue Chip Stamps? 
WARREN BUFFETT: It could — I think it’s very — I’ll answer the second part first. 
I think it’s very unlikely — very, very unlikely, you know, down to a few percentage points, that 
newspapers will go the way of Blue Chip Stamps. 
World Book is a different story. World Book has got — they have a reasonable shot at a decent 
future. But it’s not automatic. 
But the newspaper, it may be configured somewhat differently. It may get a different 
percentage of its revenue from circulation and advertising than it does. I mean, there may be 
some evolutionary-type changes in it. But it’s still a bargain. 
It is a bargain to anybody that is interested in their community. It’s still a bargain to a great 
many advertisers. 
We spend a lot of money advertising in newspapers in our various businesses. And we feel we 
are getting our money’s worth, obviously. And it works. 
But it just doesn’t have the lock that it used to have on the business. 
11. Why $7B of insurance float is better than $7B of cash 
WARREN BUFFETT: Now, what was the other question about? 
Did you want to repeat the first one? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, yeah, the question about the insurance business, the intrinsic value. 
I would say this. We have — I’m not going to give you a precise answer, but I will tell you this. 
We have 7 billion, presently, of float. That’s the money we’re holding that belongs to someone 
else but that we have the use of. 
Now, if I were asked, would I trade that for $7 billion and not have to pay tax on the gain that 
would result if I did that, but I would then have to stay out of the insurance business forever — 
total forever non-compete clause of any kind in insurance — would I accept that? And the 
answer is no. 
Now, that is not because I would rather have 7 billion of float than 7 billion of net proceeds of 
free money. It’s because I expect the 7 billion to grow. 
And if I’d made that trade — that I’m just suggesting now — if I’d made that 27 years ago and 
said, “Will you take 17 million for the float you have, no tax to be paid, the float for which you 
just paid 8-million-7 when we bought the companies, and gotten out of the insurance 
business,” I might’ve said yes in those days, but it would’ve — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Oh, you would’ve? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No, he keeps learning. That’s one of his tricks. (Laughter and applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: That’s probably true in this case. I’m not sure about other cases. 
But it would’ve been a terrible mistake. It would’ve been a mistake to do it 10 or 12 years ago 
with 300 million. 
It is not worth $7 billion to us to forego being in the insurance business forever at Berkshire 
Hathaway. 
Even though it would all be, you know, it would be — if it were nontaxed profits, so we got the 
full 7 billion, pure addition to equity — we would not take it. And we wouldn’t even think about 
it very long. So as Charlie says, that is not the answer that we would’ve given some time back. 
But it’s a very valuable business. 
It has to be run right. I mean, GEICO has to be run right. The reinsurance business has to be run 
right, National Indemnity, the Homestate Company. They all have to be run right. And it’s not 
automatic. 
But they have the people, the distribution structure, the reputation, the capital strength, the 
competitive advantages. They have those in place. And if nurtured, you know, they can become 
more valuable as time goes by. 
12. Keeping more mortgages has increased Freddie Mac’s risk a “tiny bit” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 4? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. I’d like to ask the chairman and Mr. Munger about Freddie Mac. 
A few years ago, I think they were earning most of their money from the guarantee fees and 
the float. Now, they’ve got the huge balance sheet, a lot of short-term liabilities. 
Do you think that’s a more risky business now and that the spread might go away in some, you 
know, less-than-foreseen event? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie, I think he aimed that one at you. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: It’s probably slightly more risky, but I don’t think they’re taking horrible 
risks. It’s still a very good business. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, what the question referred to is that, formerly, Freddie Mac 
emphasized, normally, just the guarantee of credit and then passed all interest rate risk onto 
the market. 
Now, they’ve retained, for their portfolio, a greater percentage of the mortgages that come 
through their hands. 
I think they’ve structured the liabilities quite intelligently to handle what they call in the 
investment world “the convexity problem,” but — which is that the borrower has the option of 
calling off the deal tomorrow or retaining it for 30 years. And that is a very disadvantageous 
contract to enter into, if you lend money. 
They have done quite an intelligent job of attacking that by callable debt and various things. But 
you can’t address a problem like that totally. There is no way to set up some model that 
satisfies that entire risk. 
They’ve done a good job. But as Charlie says, the larger the portfolio, as compared to guarantee 
fees — because you’ve still got the — you got the credit risk on the portfolio, and you’ve added 
a little interest rate risk at the extremes. 
And it doesn’t keep us up nights, but it’s a tiny bit riskier than it used to be. 
13. Don’t wait for downturn to buy a great company 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 5? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) — I’m the guy who asked you my question, my family last year 
— (inaudible) — my mom. This guy said fine, so I — (inaudible) — (laughter). 
I know you said do what you want. I just wanted to let you know that — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, you did what you wanted. I mean, you followed my advice. (Laughter) 
I’m batting 1.000. We’ll see what you’re batting next year. (Laughter) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I had one quick question — (inaudible) — you said, if you have three great 
companies, wonderful businesses, they could last you a lifetime. 
And I have — one thing that struck me in a way that — (inaudible) — great businesses get 
pounded down. And then you bet big on them, like American Express and Disney at one time. 
And my question is, I have capital to invest, but I haven’t yet invested it. I have three great 
companies, which I’ve identified: Coca-Cola, Gillette, and McDonald’s. 
And my question is, if I have a lifetime ahead of me, where I want to keep an investment for 
more than 20 or 30 years, is it better to wait a year or two to see if one of those companies 
stumble, or to get in now and just stay with it over a long time horizon? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, I won’t comment on the three companies that you’ve named. 
But in general terms, unless you find the prices of a great company really offensive, if you feel 
you’ve identified it — 
And by definition, a great company is one that’s going to remain great for 30 years. If it’s going 
to be a great company for three years, you know, it ain’t a great company. I mean, it — 
(Laughter) 
So, you really want to go along with the idea of something that, if you were going to take a trip 
for 20 years, you wouldn’t feel bad leaving the money in with no orders with your broker and 
no power of attorney or anything, and you just go on the trip. And you know you come back, 
and it’s going to be a terribly strong company. 
I think it’s better just to own them. I mean, you know, we could attempt to buy and sell some of 
the things that we own that we think are fine businesses. But they’re too hard to find. 
I mean, we found See’s Candy in 1972, or we find, here and there, we get the opportunity to do 
something. But they’re too hard to find. 
So, to sit there and hope that you buy them in the throes of some panic, you know, that you 
sort of take the attitude of a mortician, you know, waiting for a flu epidemic or something, I 
mean — (laughter) — it — I’m not sure that will be a great technique. 
I mean, it may be great if you inherit. You know, Paul Getty inherited the money at the bottom, 
in ’32. I mean, he didn’t inherit it exactly. He talked his mother out of it. But — (laughter) — it’s 
true, actually. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Close enough. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, close enough, right? 
But he benefitted enormously by having access to a lot of cash in 19 — in the early ’30s — that 
he didn’t have access to in the late ’20s. And so, you get some accidents like that. 
But that’s a lot to count on. And you know, if you start with the Dow at X, and you think it’s too 
high, you know, when it goes to 90 percent of X, do you buy? 
Well, if it does, and it goes to 50 percent of X, it gets — you know, you never get the benefits of 
those extremes anyway, unless you just come into some accidental sum of money at some 
time. 
So, I think the main thing to do is find wonderful businesses. 
Is Phil Carret here? We’ve got the world —there’s the hero of investing. Phil, would you stand 
up? 
Phil is 99. He wrote a book on investing in 1924 [“Buying a Bond”]. (Applause) 
Phil has done awfully well by finding businesses he likes, and sticking with them, and not 
worrying too much about what they do day to day. 
There’s going to be — I think there’s going to be an article in the Wall Street Journal about Phil 
on May 28th, and I advise you all to read it. And you’ll probably learn a lot more than by coming 
to this meeting, but — 
It’s that approach of buying businesses — I mean, let’s just say there was no stock market. And 
the owner of the best business in whatever your hometown is came to you and said, “Look it, 
you know, my brother just died, and he owned 20 percent of the business. And I want 
somebody to go in with me to buy that 20 percent. 
“And the price looks a little high, maybe, but this is what I think I can get for it. You know, do 
you want to buy in?” 
You know, I think, if you like the business, and you like the person that’s coming to you, and the 
price sounds reasonable, and you really know the business, I think, probably, the thing to do is 
to take it and don’t worry about how it’s quoted. It won’t be quoted tomorrow, or next week, 
or next month. 
You know, I think people’s investment would be more intelligent, you know, if stocks were 
quoted about once a year. But it isn’t going to happen that way, so — 
And if you happen to come in to some added money at some time when something dramatic 
has happened — I mean, we did well back in 1964, because American Express ran into a crook. 
You know, we did well in 1976, because GEICO’s managers and auditors didn’t know what their 
loss reserves should’ve been the previous couple of years. 
So, we’ve had our share of flu epidemics. But you don’t want to spend your life — (laughs) — 
waiting around for them. 
14. “Change is likely to work against us” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 6. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I’m Joe Condon (PH) from London. 
Both Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger have addressed my question in annual reports and at 
previous meetings here. This is my first time. It has to do with investment in a few great, high-
technology stocks. 
I know your answer has been that, if you don’t understand it, and I can’t, after this 
performance, can’t really believe that both of you don’t understand most of the high-
technology questions. But I’m thinking about not only Microsoft but, say, Pfizer and J&J. 
All three companies, which have already proven that not only do they have a great product, 
proven management over 10 to 15 years, great market share positions, which are not easy to 
get into. 
And I, frankly, don’t see a big difference in the P/E ratios, for example, you could say, Coca-Cola, 
or, you know, against Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer, which are very powerful companies. I 
wonder if either or both of you would address that question again. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Charlie, why don’t you? (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: If you have something you think you understand that looks very attractive 
to you, we think it’s smart to do what you understand. If — we’ve been unable to find 
companies that fit our slender talents. 
We well might have been in the Pfizers and Microsofts and so forth. But we’ve never had to 
revert to it. 
We don’t sneer at it. Other people with more talent have found that a wonderful course of 
action. 
WARREN BUFFETT: We generally look at businesses — we feel change is likely to work against 
us. We do not have great ability — we do not think we have great ability to predict where 
change is going to lead. 
We think we have some ability to find businesses where we don’t think change is going to be 
very important. 
Now, at a Gillette, the product is going to be better 10 years from now than now, or 20 years 
from now than 10 years from now. You saw those earlier ads going back to the Blue Blade and 
all that. The Blue Blade seemed great at the time. But they keep — the shaving technology gets 
better and better. 
But you know that Gillette — although they had that little experience with Wilkinson in the 
early ’60s — but you know that Gillette is basically going to be spending many multiples the 
money on developing better shaving systems than exist now, compared to anyone else. 
You know, they’ve got the distribution system. They’ve got the believability. If they bring out a 
product, and they say, “This is something that men ought to look at,” men look at it. 
And they found out here a few years ago that the same thing happened when they said to 
women to look at it in the shaving field. They wouldn’t have that same credibility someplace 
else. But in the shaving field, they have it. 
Those are assets that can’t be built. And they’re very hard to destroy. 
So change — we think we know, in a general way, what the soft drink industry or the shaving 
industry or the candy business is going to look like 10 or 20 years from now. 
We think Microsoft is a sensational company run by the best of managers. But we don’t have 
any idea what that world is going to look like in 10 or 20 years. 
Now, if you’re going to bet on somebody that is going to see out and do what we can’t do 
ourselves, I’d rather bet on Bill Gates than anybody else. 
But that — I don’t want to bet on anybody else. I mean, in the end, we want to understand, 
ourselves, where we think a business is going. And if somebody tells us the business is going to 
change a lot, in Wall Street, they love to tell you that, you know, that’s great opportunity. 
They don’t think it’s a great opportunity when Wall Street itself is going to change a lot, 
incidentally. (Laughter) 
But they — you know, it’s a great opportunity. We don’t think it’s an opportunity at all. I mean, 
we — it scares the hell out of us. Because we don’t know how things are going to change. 
We are looking, you know — when people are chewing chewing gum, we have a pretty good 
idea how they chewed it 20 years ago and how they’ll chew it 20 years from now. And we don’t 
really see a lot of technology going into the art of the chew, you know? (Laughter) So, that — 
And as long as we don’t have to make those other decisions, why in the world should we? I 
mean, you know, if I — all kinds of things, we don’t know. And so, why going around trying to 
bet on things we don’t know, when we can bet on the simple things? 
Zone 1? (Applause) 
I can see the shareholders like us sticking with the simple ones. They understand us, yeah. 
15. We don’t reveal more about our stocks than we have to 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, Warren. Jerry Zucker (PH), Los Angeles, California. 
In the annual report, the second-largest holdings of unsecured securities are labeled, “Others.” 
Could you please expand on some of the holdings there? Like, do we still own PNC? And are we 
supposed to be buying Big Macs, as the press has reported? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, well, actually, it’s a very descriptive title, “Others.” (Laughter) 
We do that for several reasons. But one is that we have no interest in people buying Berkshire 
or looking at the Berkshire report or anything else, in order to generate investment ideas for 
themselves. Some people may do it, but we are not in that business. 
Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are not being paid for that. There is no way it benefits the 
owners of the company. 
So, we will not disclose, in the way of our security holdings, more than we feel we have to 
disclose in order to be fair about things that can be material to the company. 
And we certainly have no interest in disclosing them to people who, essentially, want to use the 
information to try and figure out where our buying power may be, subsequently, or something 
of the sort. 
So, we will keep raising the cutoff level. And you may see more and more in others. 
And I will say this. There’s a lot of speculation about what we do, in the press, and I’d say about 
half of it’s accurate and about half of it’s inaccurate. 
And again, we leave to you the fun of figuring out which half is right. (Laughter) 
Yeah, we hope you get a lot for your money in buying a share of Berkshire. But we don’t want 
to act as an investment advisory service. 
16. Buffett isn’t worrying about the Y2K computer problem 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: David Coles, Appleton, Wisconsin. 
Earlier, you made reference to the vicissitudes of time. What are the plans to ensure that all the 
computer systems and companies in which Berkshire has an interest will function correctly with 
dates of January 1st of the year 2000 and beyond? 
And what will you do to reassure shareholders that we will not suffer serious business loss or 
failure due to incorrect handling of these dates by computer systems? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, actually, I’ve got a friend that’s quite involved in the — (laughter) — 
question of — no, I’m serious about that — the 2000 question with computers. But that’s the 
kind of thing I don’t worry about. 
I mean, I will let the people who run the operating businesses work on that. And I’ll work on 
capital allocation. And I have a feeling, one way or another, we’ll get through it. 
But like I say, we have — there are a lot of things at Berkshire we don’t — (applause) — we 
don’t spend a lot of time on a lot of things at the headquarters that other companies have 
whole departments on. 
And our managers have not let us down. I mean, I must say that we’ve got a group at one 
business after another. And they focus on their business. And they mail the money to us in 
Omaha. And we’re all happy. (Laughter) 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I have the feeling that our people will be quite good at keeping the 
computer systems in order and with backups. I also have the feeling that few companies could 
handle a big computer snafu better than we could. 
I have the feeling the Coca-Cola stock would be there. The Gillette stock would be there. The 
Nebraska Furniture Mart would be full of furniture and know the customers. 
I don’t think a computer crash is going to do us in. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. You’re correct, though, that that is a problem for the computer world. 
But as Charlie says, it’ll hit other people a lot harder than it hits us. 
Most of the things — we try to be in businesses that are fairly simple and that can’t get all 
messed up. 
And by and large, I think that we’ve got an unusual portfolio of those. And when it gets to our 
investees, you know, they’re going to worry about those problems themselves. 
We really worry about allocating money around Berkshire and having the right managers in 
place. That — if we can do those two right, everything else’ll take care of itself. 
17. Berkshire businesses are “way easier to predict” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 3? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Peter Bevelin from Sweden. 
You have said that you like franchise companies, companies that have — that are castles 
surrounded by moats, companies that are possible to — you can have some prediction five, 10 
years down the road. 
But aren’t businesses like See’s Candy, the furniture business, the jewelry business, the shoe 
business, businesses that are hard to predict the future, five, 10 years down the road? 
WARREN BUFFETT: What was that on the last part of that? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Aren’t these businesses hard to predict five or 10 years down the road? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I think — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Things like shoe business and — 
WARREN BUFFETT: I think they’re far easier to predict than most businesses. I think I can come 
closer to telling you the future of virtually all of the businesses we have, and not just because 
we have them — I mean, if they belonged to somebody else — than if I took the Dow 30, 
excluding the ones we own, or you know, the first 100 companies alphabetically on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
I think ours are way easier to predict. There are fair — they tend to be fundamental things, 
fairly simple. Rate of change is not fast, so I feel pretty comfortable. 
I think, when you look at Berkshire five years from now, the businesses we have now will be 
performing pretty much as we’ve anticipated at this time. 
I hope there are some new ones, and I hope they’re big ones. But I don’t think that we’ll have 
had lots of surprises in the present ones. 
My guess is we’ll have had one surprise. I don’t know what it’ll be. But I mean, you know, that 
happens in life. But there won’t be a series of them. 
Whereas, if you — if we were to buy — if we owned a base metals business or many retailing 
businesses I can think of, or an auto business, I’m not sure I’d know where we would stand in 
the competitive pecking order five or 10 years from now. 
I would not want to try and come in and displace See’s Candies, for example, in the business it 
does, or the Furniture Mart. It’s not an easy job. 
So, I don’t think you’ll get lots of surprises with the present businesses of Berkshire, but the key 
is developing more of them. 
18. Eisner is “most important factor” in Disney’s success 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 4? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Stafford Ordahl. I’m from Morris, New York. 
I was just wondering if the surprise could be coming from Disney. Because it seems to me 
they’ve been coasting, up until very recently, on the efforts of a person that’s no longer with 
the company, [Jeffrey] Katzenberg, who is one of those rare geniuses, like [filmmaker Steven] 
Spielberg, that has his finger on the pulse of the American people. 
And that — they don’t come along every day, even in Hollywood. 
They might be a very different company now that all of his efforts are, so to speak, out of the 
pipeline. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Have you finished, or —? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, I — Katzenberg is a real talent. I would say that, by far, I mean, by far, 
the most important person at Disney in the last 12 years, or whatever it’s been, has been [CEO] 
Michael Eisner. 
I mean, if you know him and what he has done in the business, there’s no one — [former 
President and Chief Operating Officer] Frank Wells did a terrific job in conjunction with Eisner. 
But Eisner has been the “Walt Disney,” in effect, of his tenure. He knows the business. He loves 
the business. You know, he eats and lives and breathes it. And he has been, in my view, by far, 
the most important factor in Disney’s success. 
Now, they face competition. The money is in — you know, the big money is in the animated 
films and everything that revolves around that, because you go from films to parks to character 
merchandising and back. And I mean, it’s a circular sort of thing, which feeds on itself. There’s 
going to be plenty of competition in that. 
I mean, they’ve — you know, you’ve seen what MCA and Universal’s going to do in the parks in 
Florida. And you know what DreamWorks is going to do in animation. And now, you’ve got new 
technology in animation, you know, through [Pixar CEO Steve Jobs.] And there’s a lot of things 
going on in that field. 
So the question is, 10 years from now, what place in the mind — because it’s a share of mind. 
You know, they call it share of market, but it starts with share of mind — and what place in the 
mind of billions of children around the world, and their parents, does Disney itself have, and 
their characters, relative to that owned by other organizations and other characters? 
And it’s a competitive world, so there will be people fighting for that. But I would rather start 
with Disney’s hand than anyone else’s, by some margin. And I would rather start with Michael 
Eisner running the place than with anyone else, by some margin. 
So that does not mean that it can’t become a much more competitive business. Because people 
look at the video releases of a “Lion King,” and they salivate. 
You know, you sell 30 million copies of something at whatever it may be, 16 or $17, and you 
can figure out the manufacturing cost. And you know, it gets your attention. And it gets your 
competitors’ attention. 
But going back, if I had to — if I thought the children of the world were going to want to be 
entertained 10 or 20 years from now, and I had my choice of betting on who is going to have a 
special place, if anyone has a special place, in the minds of those kids and their parents, I think I 
would probably rather bet on Disney. 
And I would feel particularly good about betting on them, if I had the guy who has done what 
Eisner has done over those years presiding in the future. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I think it helps to do the simple arithmetic. Suppose you have a billion 
children of low-middle income 20 years from now. And suppose you could make $10 per year 
per child, after taxes, from your position. It gets into very large numbers. 
And — (laughter) — I don’t know about your children and grandchildren, but mine want to see 
Disney. And they want to see it — (applause) — over and over and over again. They don’t want 
to see Katzenberg. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well I — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I mean, in terms of the trade name. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: It’s a pretty good trade name. I mean, when you think about names around 
the world, it’s interesting that, you know, it’s very hard to beat the name Coca-Cola. But 
Disney’s got a — it’s very, very big name. 
And Charlie’s point that they want to see them over and over again, and it’s kind of nice to be 
able to recycle Snow White every seven or eight years. You hit a different crowd. 
And — (laughter) — it’s kind of like having an oil field, you know, where you pump out all the oil 
and sell it. And then it all seeps back in over seven or eight years. (Laughter) 
19. Why Wall Street businesses are “tough” to manage 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 5? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I’m Randall Bellows (PH) from Chicago. Thank you for this marathon 
question-and-answer period. 
WARREN BUFFETT: We enjoy it. Thanks. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. My question is on the security business, Wall Street firms, in 
general, and specifically, what you feel about Salomon at this time. Thank you. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we know more about the security business than we knew 10 years 
ago. (Laughter) 
And it, you know, it is a tough business to manage. 
There’s a lot of money made in the business and then — throughout Wall Street, I’m talking 
about. There’s, you know, there’s very big sums of money made. And then the question is, how 
does it get divided up between the institution and the people there? 
And you get to this question — I’ve often used the analogy of, you know, would you rather — if 
you’re an investor, and you get a chance to buy the Mayo Clinic, you know, that is one sort of 
an investment. And if you get a chance to buy the local brain surgeon, that’s another one. 
You buy the local brain surgeon and his practice for X millions of dollars. And the next day, you 
know, what do you own? 
And if you’re buying the local brain surgeon, you would not pay any real multiple of earnings 
because he’s going to have this revelation, several days later, that it’s really him and not you 
there, with your little stock certificate, that’s producing the earnings. And it’s his reputation. 
And he doesn’t care. 
Can you imagine Berkshire Hathaway advertising brain surgery, you know, how much business 
we would do? 
So — (laughter) — he owns the business, even though you’ve got the stock certificate. 
Now, if you go to the Mayo Clinic, no one can name the name of anybody at the Mayo Clinic, 
unless you live within 10 miles of Rochester [Minnesota]. 
And there, the institution has the power. Now, it has to keep quality up and do all the things 
that an institution has to do. But whoever owns the Mayo Clinic has an asset that is 
independent of the attitude of any one person in the place the next day. 
Wall Street has a mix of both. And there are some businesses that are more — where the value 
resides more in the institution. And there are some where the value resides more in the 
individuals. 
We’ve got a couple of sensational people running Salomon. And they wrestle with this problem 
as they go along. And they seem to be wrestling considerably more successfully currently than 
was the case close to a year ago. 
But it is not an easy business to run. And it’s not an easy business to predict, unless you have a 
business that’s very institutional in character, and there aren’t many of those in Wall Street. 
20. Not important if part of the market is “kind of screwy” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 6? 
Sorry we got a — the microphone’s over here. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: (Inaudible) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Just raise your hand and the monitor will supply the microphone. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. Howard Winston (PH) from Cincinnati, Ohio. 
One question. Are you concerned about the rising valuations on the NASDAQ market, where 
companies trade at multiples of revenues instead of multiples of earnings? 
WARREN BUFFETT: The rising value of what, did you say? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: The NASDAQ market — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Oh. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: — where they trade at 10 times revenues or more, 30 times revenues, 
instead of 10 times earnings? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. Well, we don’t pay much attention to that. Because throughout the 
careers Charlie and I have had in investing, there have always been hundreds of cases, or 
thousands of cases, of things that are ridiculously priced, and phony stock promotions, and the 
gullible being led in to believe in things that just can’t come true. 
So that’s always gone on. It always will go on. And it doesn’t make any difference to us. 
I mean, we are not trying to predict markets. We never will try and predict markets. We’re 
trying to find wonderful businesses. And the fact that a part of the market is kind of screwy, you 
know, that’s unimportant to us. 
We tried, a few times, shorting some of those things in our innocence of youth. And it’s very 
tough to make money shorting even the obvious frauds. And there are some obvious frauds. 
It really is — it’s not tough — it’s not so tough to find the obvious frauds, and it’s not tough to 
be right over 10 years. But it’s very tough to make money being short them, although we tried a 
few times way back. 
It’s — we don’t look at indicia from stocks in general, or from P/Es, or price-sales ratios, or what 
other things are doing. 
We really just focus on businesses. We don’t care if there’s a stock market. I mean, would we 
want to own Coca-Cola, the 8 percent we own of Coca-Cola, or the 11 percent or Gillette, if 
they said, you know, “We’re just going to delist the stock and we’re never — you know, we’ll 
open it again in 20 years?” 
It’s fine with us, you know. And if it goes down on the news, we’ll buy more of it. So we care 
about what the business does. Yeah. 
21. A business is more important than where it’s based 
WARREN BUFFETT: Norton, did — why don’t you give him the microphone there? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you, Warren, for including me — (Buffett laughs) — out of order. 
WARREN BUFFETT: It’s good to have you here. Norton [Dodge] represents a family that came in 
nineteen-fifty — 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Six. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Six! Yeah, that joined up with the partnership and has been with us ever 
since. (Applause) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: A very, very fortunate connection. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Both ways, Norton, both ways. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: And — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Careful, Norton. We don’t want you mobbed on the way out. (Laughter) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: But I might say that it all began with my father [Homer Dodge] discovering 
— thanks to a professor of finance that was also at the University of Oklahoma — Ben Graham, 
back in 1940. 
And then later, when Ben Graham was about to retire, we were trying to find his protégé. And 
clearly, that was Warren. And so he belongs to that long tradition. 
But the question I wanted to ask was, you’ve mentioned the very strong companies that 
Berkshire has that are really international companies, like Coca-Cola and the — Gillette. 
But are you considering, or have you ever thought of considering, the foreign companies that 
are undervalued? Or have you, for some reason, not included that in your universe of 
companies to consider? 
WARREN BUFFETT: We’ve looked at companies domiciled in other countries. And we continue 
to look at companies domiciled in other countries. 
We wouldn’t — you know, we’re happy for the U.S. and for Atlanta that Coca-Cola’s domiciled 
in Atlanta. But would we pass on it if it happened to be domiciled in England? No, we’d love it, 
if it were domiciled in England, too. 
And we feel that the important thing is the business, not the domicile. Although, it’s — A, we’re 
more familiar, in a general way, with domestic companies that are domiciled here, although 
they make — they may make their money internationally. 
And we feel a tiny bit more comfortable, just a tiny bit, in terms of understanding the nuances 
of taxes, and politics, and shareholder governance, and all of that in something where we’ve 
been reading and thinking about it daily than someplace where we’ve had a little less 
experience. 
But we would love to find a wonderful business that is domiciled in any one of 30 or so 
countries around the world. 
We look some. We don’t look as hard as we look at domestic companies. We’re not as familiar 
with them. 
But I have read hundreds of annual reports of companies spread around the world. And we’ve 
owned a few, just a couple. 
They’re usually not as big, so just getting the kind of money in, in many cases, is more of a 
problem. But some of them are big. 
And we do not have such a surplus of ideas that we can afford to ignore any possibilities. And if 
we can find something with a market cap, probably, of at least $5 billion or greater, that strikes 
us as having our kind of qualities, and the price is right and everything, we will buy. 
22. We never reach “for an extra eight of a percent” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 1? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett. I’m Nelson Coburn (PH) from Silver Spring, 
Maryland. I have one question I want to ask that hasn’t come up here yet. 
Where does the money sit that comes in, say, from dividends and whatever other income that 
comes into Berkshire, that you’re waiting to invest someplace else? Is it get — someplace 
where it’s taking in a profit? Or is it just sitting, gathering dust? (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we only have about four or five commercial paper names we accept. 
We’re very picky about where we put — the money all gets invested. We do not have anything 
sitting around in a safe or anyplace else. So it’s all invested. 
But we do not get venturesome, in the least, in terms of where our short-term money goes. So 
we only have, like I say, maybe four or five approved names on commercial paper, all of which I 
approve. I mean, if anything ever goes haywire on this, it’s my fault. 
Right now, we have, maybe, a billion and something in relatively short-term Treasurys. And we 
have a little extra in some commercial paper, maybe. 
But you will never see us reaching for an extra eighth of a percent on short-term yields. 
Some of you may remember the fiasco in the — in Penn Central, in the commercial paper 
market. And Penn Central, around 1970 or thereabouts, was paying a quarter of a point, as I 
remember, more than other commercial paper issuers. 
And of course, they, one day, despite showing a positive net worth, I think, of a billion and a 
half or so, they said they had a lot of net worth but no cash. Turned out cash was more 
important. And so they defaulted. 
Now, the interesting thing about doing that is, if you’re getting a quarter of a point extra, and 
you came over on the Mayflower, and you landed, and you said, “Well, I’m going to apply 
myself to getting a quarter of a point extra on short-term money,” and you didn’t make any 
mistake until you got to Penn Central, you would — aside from the compounding aspect — you 
would be behind at that point. 
And I don’t like a business that you can do right for 300 years and then make one mistake and 
— (laughter) — be behind. 
So we are very picky about short-term paper. But it is all invested. And when it’s large amounts, 
it probably will be in Treasurys. A couple firms’ commercial paper, we take. 
23. Volatile earnings to be expected at Salomon 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2, please? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is George Gotti (PH) from Zurich, Switzerland. I’ve got a 
question with respect to Salomon. 
Salomon experienced quite a large volatility in profits and even revenues in the past years. 
What are your views on how this will develop in the future with respect to volatility in profits 
and revenues? 
WARREN BUFFETT: I didn’t get a hundred percent of that, Charlie. Want to —? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, well — 
WARREN BUFFETT: I can see, he can hear. We make a great combination. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, you can see we aren’t wasting much around the joint. (Laughter) 
Salomon’s earnings have always been volatile, at least all the time I’ve been around the place. 
And I don’t think that that volatility will — is likely to disappear. 
All that said, we very much like the people at Salomon. And they’ve done a ton of business with 
Berkshire over the years and in a whole lot of different capacities. And they’ve done it very 
well. 
So we’re high on the firm, as a customer. And the firms we like, as a customer, we think, 
maybe, other people will like, as a customer. And generally, we love it, volatile or no. 
WARREN BUFFETT: If you — at Salomon, as well as other firms of that type, they mark their 
securities to market. And so the changes in those marks go through earnings daily, actually, but 
you see them quarterly. 
Interestingly, if you took Berkshire over the last 30 years, and marked to market, as we do now 
for balance sheet purposes, but not for income statement purposes, because the rules are 
different in that case — if you did that, you would see enormous volatility, quarter to quarter, 
in Berkshire’s figures. 
You would — I don’t think you’d necessarily have seen any down year. But you would’ve seen 
swings between a few percent and, perhaps, 50 percent or something. 
And if you looked quarterly, you’d have seen a number of quarters of losses. And you would’ve 
seen some great upsurges, too. 
The volatility would be extreme, if it had all been run through the income account. But 
accounting convention does not call for running it through the income account, in the case of 
Berkshire. And it does, in the case of Salomon. 
But the nature of their business is volatile earnings. The nature of most Wall Street businesses 
is going to be volatile earnings. Some may follow policies that tend to make it look a little less 
volatile than it might actually be, even. 
The real thing that counts is two things, really. I mean, it’s running it so that the volatility never 
kills you in any way, and the second is having a decent return on equity over time. And I think 
that the people at the top of Salomon are very focused on that. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I think it’s illogical for the credit rating agencies to mark down Salomon as 
much as they do because the earnings are volatile. But they’re in a style business. And it’s their 
game. 
24. Very little interaction between Berkshire subsidiaries 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone — what are we? Zone 3 now? Yeah, zone 3. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. I have three quick questions. 
Do you have any formal or informal way where the managements — I know that you don’t 
interfere with the managements of the holdings — but where they can cross-pollinate ideas, for 
instance, you know, selling World Book through the GEICO channel or something like that? 
WARREN BUFFETT: I’ll answer that right now. There’s very, very, very little of that, I — you 
know, maybe once in two or three years, maybe some idea might strike me as worth passing 
along. But I — they’re doing fine running their own operations. 
We don’t do it within Berkshire, either. They really go their own way. 
Now, they know what businesses we’re in. And so they can always go directly to somebody 
else. But they don’t need me to communicate. 
25. Lloyd’s of London reputation problems have helped Berkshire 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 4? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Mike Macey (PH) from Las Vegas, Nevada. 
My question is this. There have been some recent news articles on the problems at Lloyd’s. 
What effect, if any, do you see the problems at Lloyd’s having on an increase in the Berkshire 
insurance or reinsurance business? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I think, probably, I think it’s fair to say that the problems of Lloyd’s 
have helped us because Lloyd’s had a terrific reputation. It was the first stop and, usually, the 
last stop for all kinds of unusual risks and large risks 20 years ago. 
And the fact that they have lost some of their luster in that period has helped us. And, you 
know, we didn’t do anything to contribute to it, but it obviously benefits us, as a competitor, 
when questions develop about an organization which has been a premier player in the industry. 
So, Berkshire probably possesses more capital than all of Lloyd’s put together, and it has 
established a reputation for being willing to quote on very large risks very quickly and to do 
exactly what it says. And it might very well be that, in many cases, we would get a call before 
they would get the call now. 
So we’ve been a beneficiary and, probably, in a fairly good-sized way, from their problems. And 
it’s more difficult for them to make inroads on us now than would’ve been the case 10 years 
ago. 
We have a — I don’t like to lay it on too strong — but we do have a preeminent position in a 
certain area of really large-scale reinsurance that will be difficult for anyone else to replicate. 
Now, they may not like our prices. There may not be demand for some of the things we can do. 
But if there is demand, we are very likely to get some very significant business out of that 
position. And we’ve seen it some in recent years. And we’ll see it more in the future. 
26. “We assume we’ll be around forever” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 5? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mike Assail (PH) from New York City with a question for Charlie about the 
hundred or so models we ought to have in our head — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Here we go. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: — mentioned at the end of the excellent “Worldly Wisdom” speech. 
I’d like to know the most useful models on industry consolidation, on product extension, on 
vertical integration, and any models which explain the special cases when it makes sense to 
invest in retailing stocks. And if Warren has anything to add or subtract, I’d love to hear it. 
Thank you very much. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I’m glad to answer such a modest question. (Laughter) 
I spoke about having a hundred models in your head. But those are all great, big models of 
considerable generality that are useful over and over again. 
Now, you’re down into very complex sub-modeling when you get into a separate model for 
what’s going to happen in industrial consolidations and retail and so on, and I’m not up to all 
those sub-models. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: The truth is, you know, we’re up to a few. But we take the general models 
and, you know, plug them in. And sometimes, the light goes on. And sometimes, it doesn’t. But 
if it does, they could be quite useful. 
If you focus, you do see repetition of certain business patterns and business behavior. And Wall 
Street tends to ignore those, incidentally. I mean, Wall Street really doesn’t seem to learn, for 
very long, business lessons. 
It may not be to their advantage to learn it. Charlie would — that would probably plug right in 
to Charlie’s model. It’s — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: You bet. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. It’s better, if you’re out selling the future, it may be better to forget 
the past, if you’re getting paid on selling it and not on betting your life on it in some way. 
One situation at Berkshire that really is somewhat different than many companies: we assume, 
and unfortunately, it’s in error, but we assume we’ll be around forever. 
So when we — in our insurance business, we assume we’re going to be here to pay every claim. 
And we’re not going to retire at 65 and hand over something to someone else. And there 
wouldn’t be any sense paying games on accounting because it would catch up with us later on. 
And whereas, in many businesses, I don’t think they have quite the same horizon on things. 
They do at a Coca-Cola, or they do at a Gillette. 
But many companies are thinking about what kind of — I think, I’m afraid that, more than you’d 
like — are thinking about what little pictures they can paint for the next four quarters or so. 
And that’s easy to do. 
But our problem is we’re going to be around a lot longer, we think, than four quarters, so that’s 
not an option available to us. And we have to — we really run it as if, in the year 2050 or 
something, somebody’s going to look and say, “Did — how’d it work out?” 
27. Compensation plans must include cost of capital 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone, where are we, 5 or 6? Wherever the microphone is. 
Zone 5, we got a mic over there? Maybe that was — 6! OK, we’ll go to 6. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You state, in your letter — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Could you have the microphone? Or do we have one in the — yeah. Want 
to bring him the microphone? Particularly for the people behind you, it’s a little difficult. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Glen Rollins (PH), Atlanta, Georgia. 
You state, in your letters to shareholders, that with your wholly owned companies, you reward 
them at a higher rate when they release capital to you. And you, likewise, charge them a higher 
rate when they need capital. Could you elaborate on that? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, we — some of our businesses don’t need capital at all, or need so little 
that it doesn’t make sense to build it into a formula. 
So we have certain businesses, those are the best businesses, incidentally, that take — to take, 
essentially, no capital because it means that, if you double the size of the business, you don’t 
need any more capital. And those are really wonderful businesses. And we’ve got a few of 
those. 
But where our businesses do produce capital, we could have all kinds of complicated systems 
and have capital budgeting groups at headquarters and do all kinds of things. 
But we just figure it’s simpler to charge people a fair amount for the money and then let them 
figure out, you know, whether they really want to buy a new slitter or whatever it may be in 
their business. 
And it varies a little bit. It varies on the history of when we came in. It varies on interest rates 
that they — but we generally will be charging people something in the area of 15 percent, in 
terms of working out compensation arrangements for capital. 
Now, 15 percent pretax, depending on state income taxes, is only 9 to 9 1/2 percent after-tax. 
So you can say that isn’t even enough to charge people, but we find that 15 percent gets their 
attention. 
And it should get their attention, but it shouldn’t be such a high-hurdle rate that things that we 
want to do don’t get done. 
Our managers expect to be running their businesses for a long, long time. So we don’t worry 
about them doing something that works for them in the next year but doesn’t work five years 
out or vice — you know, where they don’t make longer plans, because they see themselves as 
part-owners of the business. But we want them to be owners with a cost attached to capital. 
We think it’s awful, frankly, the way businesses reward executives with absolutely no regard for 
the cost of capital. I mean, a fixed-price option for 10 years — you know, imagine giving 
somebody an interest-free loan for 10 years. You’re not going to do it. 
And if a company is retaining a significant part of its earnings, and you give out a fixed-price 
option for 10 years, you know, they can do nothing with it but put it in a savings account, and 
they’ll make some money off of it. So it — we like attaching a cost to the capital. 
If we had options for me and Charlie at Berkshire, which would not — it’s not going to happen, 
but it would not be illogical. We have responsibility for the whole place. 
You could have some kind of a compensation arrangement that worked in respect to how the 
whole enterprise fared, and it would make sense for the two of us. 
It wouldn’t make sense for the rest of our managers because they work on specific units. And 
you should have compensation arrangements that apply to those units. 
But assuming you had it for the two of us — which we’re not going to have, I want to assure 
you — but we would say the fair way to do that would be to have an option at not less than 
present intrinsic value. 
Forget what the market price is. Because, believe me, it — the idea of having the more 
depressed your market price be, the better your option price be, does not make any sense. 
So we would have it at not less than intrinsic value. And then we would have it step up yearly 
based on something relating to a cost to capital. Because we would say, “Why should we get 
free use of the shareholders’ capital?” And we could work out a fair stock option. 
That would be perfectly appropriate. We won’t do it, but it’d be a perfectly appropriate way to 
have us compensated that involved an issuance, then an initial price of not less than intrinsic 
value, and involve carrying costs. 
And then we would be in a position, still, not totally analogous to shareholders, because we 
wouldn’t have a downside that you have, but we would at least have the carrying cost that you 
have of ownership. 
And we work that through into our unit compensation plans by having a cost of capital that, like 
I say, tends to run about that 15 percent area. 
And if people can give us money, we should be able to figure out a way to do something better 
than 15 percent pretax with it. That’s part of our job, too. So we will pay them to give us back 
money. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, we really invented a more extreme system. And that is the executives 
can buy Berkshire Hathaway stock in the market for cash. 
This is a — (laughter) — very old-fashioned system, but most of them — it doesn’t take any 
lawyers, or compensation consultants, or — and most of them have done it. And most of them 
have done very well with it. I don’t know why it doesn’t spread more. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: People say they want their management to think like shareholders. 
Management, you know, they’re compensating them. We’re going to have them think like 
shareholders. It’s very easy to think like a shareholder. Become one, you know? (Laughter) 
And you’ll think exactly like a shareholder. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Right, right. 
WARREN BUFFETT: It’s not a great — it’s not a huge psychological hurdle to get over, if you 
actually write a check. (Laughter) 
28. Unlike many movie companies, Disney makes money for shareholders 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 1? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: John Lichter from Boulder, Colorado. 
Are there some worthwhile books that you could recommend to us? 
And secondly, with respect to Eisner and Disney, how would you define Michael Eisner’s circle 
of competence? And are you concerned that he might step outside it? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I would say that he has proven himself very good at understanding 
what Disney is really all about. 
And you can look back to the predecessor management, between Walt and Eisner. And they 
didn’t really do much with that, if you look at those years. 
What is special about Disney? And how do you make it more special? And how do you make it 
more special to more people? I mean, those are the things that you want to — and you’ve got 
wonderful ingredients to work with when you’re working with something like Disney. 
I mean, it — you know, one of the advantages — we were talking about the Mayo Clinic and 
brain surgeons. The nice thing about the mouse is that he doesn’t have an agent, you know. I 
mean, the mouse is yours. (Laughs) 
He is not in there renegotiating and, you know, every week or every month and saying, you 
know — (laughter) — “Just look at how much more famous I’ve become in China,” you know, or 
something. (Laughter) 
So if you own the mouse, you own the mouse. And Eisner understands all of that very well. I 
would say he’s been very skillful, in terms of how he’s thought about it. 
I worry about any manager. It has nothing to do with Michael Eisner. But Charlie and I worry 
about ourselves in terms of getting out of our circle of competence. 
And we’ve done it. It is very tempting. And it’s probably part of the human condition, in terms 
of hubris or something, that if, you know, that if you’ve — as Charlie would say, if you’ve — you 
know, if you’re a duck floating on a pond, and it’s been raining, and you’re going up in the 
world, after a while, you think it’s you and not the rain. 
You know, that there — that you’re some duck. (Laughter) But — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Right, right. 
WARREN BUFFETT: And we all succumb to that a little bit. 
But I think that Disney, Coca-Cola, Gillette — I think those companies are very focused. I think 
our operating units are very focused. 
And I think that gives us a huge advantages over the managers that are getting a little bored 
and decide that they’d better fool around with this or that to show just how talented they really 
are. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. Eisner is quite creative. And he also distrusts projections. And that is a 
very good combination to have in the motion picture business. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, Charlie was a lawyer for, what, 20th Century in the old — 
CHARLIE: Yes. 
WARREN BUFFETT: — days? Yeah, and he saw a little bit of how Hollywood operated. And it 
kept us out of buying any motion picture stocks for about 30 years. Every time I’d go near one, 
he’d regale me with a few stories of the past. 
So it’s a business where people are — can trade other people’s money for their own 
significance in their world. And that is a dangerous combination, where if I can buy significance 
in my world with your money, you know, there’s no telling what I’ll do. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Part of the business reminds me of an oil company in California. And it was 
controlled by one individual. And people used to say, about it, “If they ever do find any oil, that 
old man will steal it.” (Laughter) 
The motion picture business, it’s only about half of it that has normal commercial morals. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, we’re not applying that to Disney. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: No. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Disney is really — Disney’s done an extraordinary job for the shareholders. 
And they make real money out of movies. Most movie companies have — they make money for 
everybody associated with it, but not a lot has stuck to the shareholders. 
Zone 2? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I — 
29. Book recommendations 
WARREN BUFFETT: What? Oh, the books! Charlie, what are you reading these days? (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I’m almost ashamed to report because I’ve gone back and picked up 
the part of biology that I put up — should’ve picked up 10 or 15 years earlier. And if any of you 
haven’t done it, it’s a total circus, what they figured out over the last 20 or 30 years in biology. 
And I — if you take [evolutionary biologist Richard] Dawkins, “The Selfish Gene” and “The Blind 
Watchmaker”, I mean, these are marvelous books. And there are words in those books that are 
entering the English language that are going to be in the next Oxford Dictionary. I mean, these 
are powerful books. And they’re a lot of fun. 
I had to read “The Selfish Gene” twice before I fully understood it. And there were things I 
believed all my life that weren’t so, and I think it’s just wonderful, when you have those 
experiences. We always say, “It isn’t the learning that’s so hard. It’s the unlearning.” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. I made the mistake of taking Charlie up to Microsoft in December. 
And he became friends with [Chief Technology Officer] Nathan Myhrvold. 
And they are corresponding back and forth with increasing fervor and enthusiasm about mole 
rats. And they copy me on all these communications. So I’m getting to see this flow back and 
forth on the habits of mole rats. 
I really haven’t found a way to apply it at Berkshire. But I’m sure Charlie — (laughs) — has got 
something he’s working on, on that. He’s gotten very interested in biology lately. 
I like — you know, I’ve always liked reading biography, but since the — the computer has 
changed my life. I now find myself playing bridge on the computer about 10 hours a week. And 
unfortunately, I didn’t want to give up sleep or eating or Berkshire. So the reading has been 
kind of light. 
On investment books, if you’re asking about that, I would recommend the first two books that 
Phil Fisher wrote back around 1960, “Common Sense [Stocks] and Uncommon Profits” and the 
second one [“Paths to Wealth Through Common Stocks”]. They’re very good books. 
You know, I obviously recommend, first and foremost, [Benjamin Graham’s] ”The Intelligent 
Investor,” with chapters eight and 20 are the ones that you really should read. 
Two of the — well, all of the important ideas in investing, really, are in that book, because 
there’s only about three ideas. And those — two of them are emphasized in those two 
chapters. 
Actually, I think John Train’s “Money Masters” is an interesting book. 
I don’t know. Can you think of any others, Charlie, that we want to tout? (Laughs) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I don’t know. We have such a fingers-and-toes style around Berkshire 
Hathaway. (Laughter) So you sort of count. 
WARREN BUFFETT: The three — 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I’ve never seen — you know, Warren talks about these discounted cash 
flows. I’ve never seen him do one. (Laughter and applause) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: If it ever — 
WARREN BUFFETT: There are some things you only do in private, Charlie. (Laughter) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: If it isn’t pluperfect obvious that it’s going to work out well, if you do the 
calculation, he tends to go on to the next idea. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, it’s sort of — it is true. You don’t — if you have to actually do it on — 
with pencil and paper, it’s too close to think about. I mean, it ought to just kind of scream at 
you that you’ve got this huge margin of safety. 
I mentioned the three ideas. The three ideas, I should elaborate on. One is that — to think of 
yourself — to think of investing as owning a business and not buying something that wiggles 
around in price. 
And the second one is your attitude, which ties in with that, the attitude toward the market, 
that’s covered in chapter eight. And if you have the proper attitude toward market movements, 
it’s an enormous help in securities. 
And the final chapter is on the margin of safety, which means, don’t try and drive a 9,800-
pound truck over a bridge that says it’s, you know, “Capacity: 10,000 pounds.” But go down the 
road a little bit and find one that says, “Capacity: 15,000 pounds.” 
30. We’ll do more in insurance, but we don’t know what 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, Chip Tucker (PH), Minneapolis. 
Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, what market share does Berkshire have in super-cat insurance 
business? And what’s your outlook for both the market growth in that business and the 
potential market share growth with — from Berkshire? 
You answered a related question regarding GEICO’s auto opportunities. Are there other 
insurance businesses potentially worth expanding into? Or is your focus on super-cat and autos 
opportunity enough? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: You know, Warren can answer that question a lot better than I can. 
WARREN BUFFETT: I — we don’t — there wouldn’t be any good market share figures in 
something like super-cat. 
We know that, a couple years, and last year, I think, too, we had to be the biggest in terms of 
premium volume. 
We simply take on so much more than anyone else will. And we were getting the calls on the 
big risks, you know, 400 million here or something of the sort. We had a quote we put out on a 
billion dollars on the New Madrid fault here a little while ago. Nobody else will be doing that. 
So we got market share by our willingness to do large volume, by the fact that people knew we 
would pay subsequently, but we don’t — while we know we were the largest, we can’t give you 
any precise figures. 
We also know we’re slipping in that now, but that makes no difference to us. We’d only be 
interested if we were slipping in profitable markets. 
And what was the second part of the question on that, Charlie? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What other opportunities — 
WARREN BUFFETT: Oh, what other opportunities in the insurance business? 
We — just this year, we bought a very, very small company [Kansas Bankers Surety], the 
managers of whom are here, a very fine insurance company. It has a little niche. 
It — I mean, it will never be huge or anything of the sort, but it’s the kind of business that we 
can understand. And we like the people that run it. And we like the position they’ve achieved in 
the market. So we’re delighted to be in it. 
We are willing to think about a whole variety of things to do in insurance. But most of them, we 
find, make no sense. We’ll be — we’ll do other things in insurance over the next 10 or 15 years. 
It’s just bound to happen, but I can’t tell you what they will specifically be. 
The biggest single thing we will do in terms of value, though, probably, is grow GEICO. But we 
will do other things. And who knows what they might be? 
We have expanded some in the — it’s a small business — the structured settlement business, 
from when we talked a year or two ago. And we are the preferred provider of structured 
settlements. Those are annuities, essentially, that are payable to people who are usually the 
victims of a very bad accident. 
So they’re very severely injured people, with injuries that will probably last for life. And so we 
will be making payments to people who are incapable of earning a living, may incur substantial 
medical bills, for many decades, sometimes, 50 or 60 years. 
Those annuities are provided by our companies to other insurance companies and to these 
injured people, usually, with the approval of the injured person’s attorney. 
And when the advisors to the injured person think, “Who is going to be around in 50 years to 
pay money to this person who’s been incapacitated,” they frequently, and in our view, logically, 
think of Berkshire. So we have become much better known in that over the last couple of years. 
It’s not a big business. And it won’t be a big business. But it’s a perfectly decent business. And 
it’s one where we have a competitive advantage over time. 
We don’t obtain the competitive advantage by price. We obtain the competitive advantage 
from the peace of mind that the injured party obtains from knowing that that check will be in 
the mail 50 years from now. 
And that’s the kind of business where we have some edge. And we’ll find other things to do 
over time, but can’t — I can’t — 
It isn’t like we’re looking at some specific area and saying, “We’re focusing on this.” We’re 
aware, generally, of what’s going on in the insurance business. And we’re very ready to move 
when the time comes, so that we can do something intelligent. 
31. People rewarded by capitalism need to help those who aren’t 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 3? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, my family’s been associated with Berkshire 
since 1968. So I ask this question with a great deal of respect for your integrity and your 
wisdom. 
I work as an inner-city schoolteacher, where there is a rising and pervasive sense of 
hopelessness. 
When I ask my students, “What would make you happy?” their predominant response is, “A 
million dollars.” As some of the richest men in the world, I wonder what your response to them 
might be. 
And as a second part of this question, the philosophical underpinnings of capitalism have 
largely ignored a systemic perspective involving issues of ongoing depletion of limited global 
resources exploited to sustain a market economy, widening gaps between the very wealthy and 
the severely impoverished, and an international view of America as a country whose primary 
values are greed and imperialism. 
As we move into the 21st century, do you see a need to re-envision capitalist premises towards 
original notions of democracy, justice, and humanitarian concerns? 
WARREN BUFFETT: I didn’t get all of that. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well — (laughter) — I will say this. I am higher on the existing social order 
than you are. (Applause) 
I — there’s always plenty wrong with a social order. And certainly, there are places where ours 
is a lot more broken than it used to be. 
I don’t think Warren and I have any wonderful solution to all the problems of the world. But 
wishing for a million dollars instead of some more tangible short step is the wrong frame of 
mind. That isn’t the way we got our million dollars. 
WARREN BUFFETT: But I don’t — (Applause) 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Warren might give a different answer, by the way. He’s a — 
WARREN BUFFETT: No, I would agree with the — I, you know — wishing for a job makes a lot of 
sense to me and figuring out how to get one and then going from there. But it — 
There is and always has been — that doesn’t mean it always should be — but there is a 
tremendous amount of inequality. 
What you don’t want is an inequality of opportunity. There will be a lot of inequality in ability. 
A market system, like we have, churns out what people want. If they want to watch a 
heavyweight fight, and they want to watch Mike Tyson, they’re going to pay him $25 million for 
getting in the ring for a few minutes. 
And it produces what people like. And it produces it in abundance. And it’s done very well in 
terms of production. 
It is much better to be in the bottom 20 percent in this country now than it was 50 years ago. 
And it’s better to be in the bottom 20 percent of this country than in any other country. But it 
still isn’t very satisfactory. 
The market system does not reward — it does not reward teachers, does not reward nurses — I 
mean, it does not reward all kinds of people who do all kinds of useful things in any way 
comparable to how it will reward entertainers, or people who can figure out the value of 
businesses, or athletes, or that sort of thing. 
A market system pays very big for something that will entertain them. People want to be 
entertained a good bit of the day. And it pays better for people that will entertain than educate. 
I think — I don’t want to tinker with the market system. I don’t think I should be telling people 
what they should want to do with their lives. 
But I do think that it’s incumbent on the people that do very well under that system to be taxed 
in a manner that takes reasonable care of anybody that is not well adapted to that system, but 
that is a perfectly decent citizen in every other regard. 
And that is — you know, I don’t want to start getting into comparable worth in terms of how I 
tax. But I do think that somebody like me, that happens to just fit this system magnificently, but 
wouldn’t be worth a damn in Bangladesh or someplace, you know, because what I have 
wouldn’t pay off there — their system would not reward that. 
I think that we get from society — society provides me — this society provides me — with 
enormous rewards for what I bring to the game. And it does the same with Mike Tyson. And it 
does the same with some guy whose adenoids are right for singing or whatever it may be. 
And I don’t want to tamper with that. But I do think those people who are getting all kinds of 
claim checks on the rest of society from that — I think there should be a system that people — 
where people who are not well adapted to that system, but that are perfectly decent citizens in 
every other respect, do not really, you know, fall through the slats on that. 
And I think progress has been made on that over the last 50 years. But I think we’re far from a 
perfect society in that respect. And I hope, you know, more progress is made in the next 50 
years. 
I don’t think the wishing for the million dollars, though — you know, it doesn’t work that way. I 
think — 
But if you are lucky enough to have something that the market system rewards, you do very 
well here. And if you’re unlucky enough to have something it doesn’t reward, you do better 
now than you would’ve 30 or 40 years ago. And you do better than in other countries. 
But I can see where it seems very unjust to look at somebody else who has just a little different 
mix of talents that can achieve claim checks in a way that keeps them and the next five 
generations of their family in a position where they don’t have to do very much. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: I would say that I like a certain amount of social intervention that takes 
some of the inequality out of results in capitalism. 
But I hate, with a passion, rewarding anything that can be easily faked. Because I think then 
people lie, and lying works, and the lying spreads. And I think your whole civilization 
deteriorates. 
If I were running the world, the compensation for stress under workman’s compensation would 
be zero, not because there isn’t real stress. Because there’s no way to keep the fakery out, if 
you reward stress at all. 
WARREN BUFFETT: There was a great article, and this applies — (applause) — to an earlier 
question. 
There was a very good article in Forbes about one issue ago that showed the occupational 
profile of the U.S. at a couple of different intervals, going back to 1900. 
And one problem you can see, just by looking at that profile, is that, if you assume 20 percent of 
the — the bottom 20 percent — however you measure it, in terms of employability — whether 
it’s measured by IQ, or interest in working, or energy level, or whatever you want to do — they 
fit, very well, most of the jobs that were available a hundred years ago. 
In other words, you could do most of the jobs, of which there were many, with relatively 
unimpressive mental abilities. And as jobs have changed, the profile of people hasn’t changed. 
So there are more people that end up on the short end. 
Now, the good part of that is the society produces so much more that it can take care of those 
people, one way or another. Now, the trick is to take care of them and make them not only 
feel, but be productive and be part of the act, and — 
We’ve got enough product to do that. But the country turns out way more output than 50 or a 
hundred years ago. 
We don’t have — we’re not perfect at figuring out how to make the bottom 20 or 30 percent, in 
terms of abilities, fit a new, changing job profile. 
I really recommend you look at that Forbes magazine. Because if you think through the 
implications of those charts, I think you’ll see what social problems have to be attacked. 
32. “No magic” to running a bank — just don’t do “something foolish” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 4? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Edward Barr, Lexington, Kentucky. 
Earlier, you led us through a discussion of the competitive position of Disney. And you also 
discussed share repurchase. 
I wondered if you could also lead us through a discussion of the competitive position of Wells 
Fargo, since they just effected such a large combination [with First Interstate], in addition with, 
perhaps, some discussion of their share repurchase, which is probably as large, in percentage 
terms, as any company I can think of at the present time. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, Wells should repurchase their shares, if they feel that they’re 
repurchasing them below intrinsic business value. And that’s a calculation that they make. 
And you should — have to ask the question of them what their calculus is of that. But that will 
determine whether that share repurchase program makes good sense or not. 
The advantages of an in-market merger are — can be dramatic. Sometimes, it just causes a 
bank to do what they should’ve done anyway. 
I mean, I’m not so — I’m not always as convinced that the economies come about through — 
totally through scale, as they are just from taking a hard look at how they run their business. 
We may have in the audience today — he was here earlier — the CEO of the Bank of Granite, 
which is in Granite, North Carolina. And that bank earned 2.58 percent on assets, I believe, in 
the most recent quarter, annualized, and had a 33 percent efficiency ratio. 
Now, that bank is 400 million or 500 million of assets. You know, it doesn’t need to be 5 billion 
in order to get more efficient or anything of the sort. 
It’s got — it’s so much more efficient than any of those larger banks that had to be put together 
to get those ratios that it makes you kind of wonder about the underlying rationale. 
But I’m sure that Mr. [John] Forlines, who runs that bank, just focuses on — and he’s been 
focusing on it for a lot of years — just doing the right things day after day. And it didn’t take any 
in-market merger or anything of the sort to cause him to do that. 
I recommend any of you in the banking business to get his report because there is nothing 
magic about the community of Granite, North Carolina. 
Nor does he work under laws that are way different than the rest of bankers or anything of the 
sort. He just gets a record that — achieves a record — that makes all the rest of the records 
look silly. 
We had a fellow over in Rockford, Illinois, in the bank we owned back in the ’70s, Gene Abegg, 
whose brother is going to be 104. There was a fellow from Rockford here that got me to sign a 
note to Ed Abegg, who will be 104 soon. I wish Gene had lived to 104. 
But Gene ran a bank in Rockford that, when banks — the best banks were earning one percent 
on assets, he earned two percent on assets. And he did it with way less leverage than anyone 
else and lower loan losses and big investment portfolio. 
And there wasn’t any magic about it. He just didn’t do anything that didn’t make sense. 
And there’s a lot of room for improvement in the banking business with or without mergers. 
But I would say that Wells, on the record, has done an exceptionally good job of running their 
bank compared to other big banks. And I would say that those two operations put together will 
be run a whole lot more efficiently than if First Interstate had been run by — run on its own. 
It’s a business that can be a very good business, when run right, as the Bank of Granite or 
Illinois National Bank in Rockford proved. There’s no magic to it. You just have to stay away 
from doing something foolish. 
It’s a little like investing. You know, you don’t have to do anything very smart. You just have to 
avoid doing things that are ungodly dumb when looked at about a year later and — you know, 
airlines and that sort of thing. (Laughter) 
And you know, that’s the trick. It is not some great crystal ball game where you look into the 
future and see all these things that other people can’t possibly see. I mean, what’s complicated 
about Coca-Cola or Gillette or Wells Fargo, for that matter? 
And that’s — we like businesses like banking, if we’ve got somebody in charge of them that is 
going to run them right. We’ve got a — I don’t know whether Bob Wilmers is here. But he runs 
First Empire, which we have a good-sized investment in. Bob just runs it right, you know? 
I do not worry about surprises from Bob or First Empire. And he’ll do things — if he can grow, 
and it’s logical, he’ll grow. And if it isn’t logical to do something, he’ll pass. He has no ego 
compulsions forcing him into some sort of action. And he runs a terrific bank. 
Charlie? 
33. We do “whatever comes along that makes sense” 
WARREN BUFFETT: OK. Zone 5. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Dorothy Craig (PH) from Seattle. 
And I noticed, in the annual report, that your recent acquisitions doubled the revenue for 
Berkshire Hathaway. And it seemed astounding for me. I’m wondering how that’s possible. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it’s — for one thing, we started from kind of a small base. The — but 
we — the GEICO acquisition, you know, added 3 billion or so of revenues, and — actually more 
than that, a little more than that, but not much more. And RC Willey and Helzberg’s probably 
added 600 million or so in the current year. 
And since we were working off a base of 3 1/2 or so billion, those three acquisitions did double 
the revenues. We won’t have many years when that happens. It’s not any goal of ours to 
double the revenues or increase them 20 percent, even, or anything. 
We just — we try to do whatever comes along that makes sense. And if there’s a lot that comes 
along in one year that makes sense, we’ll do a lot. And if there’s nothing that comes along that 
makes sense, we’ll do nothing. 
So it’s — there’s a lot of accident in it. But last year, you know, a fair amount happened. And I’d 
love to see a lot happen next year. But we don’t know at this point. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Nothing. 
34. GEICO’s Lou Simpson has more investing options now 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 6. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh me? Yes, my name is Victor Lapuma (PH). And I’m from the Virgin 
Islands. And my question is on the GEICO asset side. 
One of the things that makes Berkshire unique is the high percentage in equity as opposed to 
fixed assets. And GEICO, as of the end of the year, looked like a typical insurance company with 
four times the fixed assets as equity assets. 
And my question is, over time, will they have the same composite as Berkshire on the asset 
side? 
And the second part of that question is, how are the asset allocations decisions being made at 
GEICO after the merger as compared to before the merger? 
WARREN BUFFETT: The decisions at GEICO, which, as you say, is about 5 billion of marketable 
securities, have been made, and are being made, and will be made, by Lou Simpson. Lou has 
done a fabulous job of running the investments of GEICO since about 1979. And we’re lucky to 
have him. 
There are very few people that I will let run money running businesses that we have control 
over. But we’re delighted, in the case of Lou. I mean, that’s one in a thousand or something. But 
Lou has done a terrific job, will do a good job. 
And the one thing we offer him, he has the ability to do whatever he wants to do with those 
assets now. He did not have that ability before GEICO became part of Berkshire. Because at that 
time, there were certain ratios that were necessary for — which were understandably 
necessary, that made sense. 
With GEICO as a standalone entity, with its own net worth of a billion and a half or 2 billion, and 
doing 3 billion of business, it would’ve been inappropriate for him to take on a different 
configuration, beyond a certain point, in equities. 
So he was constrained by the nature of the business he was in and its capitalization. That 
constraint no longer applies. So he, with that 5 billion, can do whatever he wants. 
Now, if he does certain things, we would need to provide backup to GEICO, so that their 
policyholders would be protected under the most adverse of circumstances. But that’s no 
problem for us. 
We could do it by quota share reinsurance. We could do a lot of things. We could just 
guarantee their obligations. And we are in a position to do that. 
We haven’t done it yet because it’s not — hasn’t been necessary yet. But if it made sense — if 
Lou wanted to be 5 billion in equities and it made sense, we would arrange things so that the 
GEICO policyholders would be every bit as secure as under the most conservative of investment 
portfolios. 
So Lou has another string to his bow now. And there may be a time when it gets used. He’s 
been great under the old system. And he may be better under this system. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: That’s a very shrewd question. You’re to be complimented. 
WARREN BUFFETT: That means it’s something we thought about — (laughs) — before, but you 
are to be complimented, right. 
35. “Permanent holdings” probably won’t be sold even if market overvalues them 
WARREN BUFFETT: Let’s see. Zone 1? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Neil McMahon (PH), New York City. 
Berkshire owns several companies — stock in several companies — which are called permanent 
holdings. 
In the early ’70s, we had a two-tier market, the one-decision stocks, high P/Es — 50, 60 times 
earnings. 
If that were to reappear again, would Berkshire’s companies still be permanent? Or is there a 
price for everything? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, there are things that we think there’s no price for. And we’ve been 
tested sometimes and haven’t sold them, but — 
You know, my friend, Bill Gates, says, you know, it has to be illogical at some point. The 
numbers have — at some price, you have to be willing to sell something that’s a marketable 
security, forgetting about a controlled business. 
But I doubt if we ever get tested on — there’s only a couple of them in that category. 
Actually, there — you know — I won’t comment on that. (Laughs) 
We really have a great reluctance to sell businesses where we like both the business and the 
people. So I don’t think I’d count on seeing many sales. But if you ever attend a meeting here, 
and there are 60 or 70 times earnings, keep an eye on me. (Laughs) 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: The so-called two-tier market created difficulties, I would say, primarily 
because a lot of people or companies were called tier one when they really weren’t. They just 
had been, at some time, a tier one. If you’re right about the companies, you can hold them at 
pretty high values. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, you can really hold them at extraordinary levels if you’ve got — it’s 
too hard to find. You’re not going to find businesses that are as good. 
So then you have to say, “Am I going to get a chance to buy back the same business at a lot 
lower price? Or am I going to buy something that’s almost as good at a lot lower price?” 
We don’t think we’re very good at doing that. We’d rather just sit and hold the business and 
pretend the stock market doesn’t exist. 
That actually has worked out way better for us than I would’ve predicted 20 years ago. I mean, 
that mindset is — or 25 years ago — that mindset is — there’s been a fair amount of good 
fortune that’s flowed out of that that I really wouldn’t have predicted. 
CHARLIE MUNGER: But there, you’re demonstrating your trick again, you know? Still learning. A 
lot of people regard that as cheating. (Laughter) 
36. Buffett doesn’t expect Gates will join Berkshire’s board 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, Alan Rank, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Knowing your aversion to technology but your close affiliation with Bill Gates, Microsoft, have 
you ever considered either inviting him to be part of the Berkshire through the board, or being 
involved to maybe solve some of the problems with World Book and taking it to the new 
technology and expanding it? 
And on the other end, you also love insurance and the float. Have you considered the other 
businesses that would have that similarity, such as cemeteries and funeral homes with their 
pre-need and their large cash reserves? 
WARREN BUFFETT: The — Bill and I talked about the encyclopedia business some years ago. But 
he was pretty far down the line at Encarta, quite far down the line at Encarta, actually, before I 
even met him. So it wasn’t — my guess is, if we had met earlier, that there might have been 
something evolve in that. 
But he had put a lot of chips on Encarta and had done a good job with it. So it really wasn’t — it 
wasn’t a real option to work with him on World Book. 
Bill also is very focused on his business. And I believe he’s on the board of some biotech 
company in which he’s got a significant investment. 
But you will not see him on the boards of, at least I don’t believe that you will, of American 
corporations — I think, if you look at the boards in the, say, up in the Pacific Northwest, where 
he had a lot of friends and knows the companies well and maybe grew up with some of the 
people. 
But I don’t think you’ll see him on anything which really doesn’t — which is just a business that 
doesn’t grab him intellectually on something. I do think there’s one biotech company that he’s 
involved in that way. And you know, he’d be a terrific asset. 
But he really focuses on Microsoft. He has his board meetings, as I remember, on Saturday. 
They last, you know, all day. And then he goes after the business that way. He’s not — 
I don’t think he’d be interested on being on a bank board or an insurance company board 
because he just figures he’s got other things to do with his time. And I think he’s probably right. 
(Laughs) 
37. Not all “float” businesses are attractive 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 3? Oh, the question was about other kinds. 
We’ve always had an interest in float businesses of one sort or another, but — 
You know, Blue Chip Stamps was such a business, until it disappeared — (laughs) — one day, 
and we couldn’t find it. We went — looked in the closet. We looked everywhere, out in the 
backyard. (Laughs) Where was it? 
So we like that sort of business. But most of the float businesses, the costs are pretty explicit. 
And like I say, we don’t like most insurance companies as float businesses. We are not 
interested in buying the typical insurance business, because we think the float will end up 
costing us too much. 
We’d rather borrow money with an explicit cost attached to it rather than have the implicit 
costs of an underwriting loss with most companies. 
But we’re always — we are interested in businesses that provide cash rather than use up cash. 
We’re willing to have them use cash, if the — if what they use will produce high enough 
returns. But we’ve got this bias toward things that throw off cash. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, if we go into the pre-need funeral home business, that’ll be the day. 
(Laughter) 
38. Expect a “better” market for Class A than Class B 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 3. (Laughter) 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Charlie is a difficult act to follow. I’m Robert Keeley (PH) from 
Washington, D.C. 
I have a brief comment and a brief question. The comment is that I think you may be 
considerably underestimating the interest there will be in purchases of Class B stock later this 
week and next week. 
I have at least 10 friends in Washington who are aware that I’m a Berkshire shareholder and 
that I was coming to this meeting. And they’ve insisted that I report back to them tomorrow on 
just what happened with the Class B stock because they’re very interested in buying some of it. 
Now, that’s anecdotal, to be sure. But if you take that ratio of 10 people to even the 
shareholders who are present here today, you’re talking about tens of thousands of people 
who are going to be in that market. 
And my question relates to liquidity. On page 18 of your annual report, you say, and I quote, 
“The prospect that most shareholders will stick to the A stock suggests that it will enjoy a 
somewhat more liquid market than the B.” 
Could you explain that? It seems to me that if most shareholders keep their A stock, do not 
convert it or sell it, that the B stock will be much more liquid. Maybe I don’t understand 
liquidity. 
WARREN BUFFETT: No, I think you do. You understand it. And I’ll elaborate just a bit. 
The — certainly, in the first week, I would expect the B stock to trade far more, although I hope 
it doesn’t trade like most new issues trade in relation to the amount sold. 
It’s just the nature of a new offering that there’s usually — there’s always some flurry of 
activity. Sometimes, I think it’s quite excessive. And I don’t think it will be with Berkshire. But 
there will be some flurry of activity. 
But longer range, let’s just assume that there’s $400 million worth of B stock. There will be 40 
billion of A. 
Now, admittedly, you know, I’m not going to do anything with my stock. And many people in 
this room have a very low tax basis and, except under very unusual circumstances, have no 
intention of doing anything with their stock. 
So of that 40 billion, there’s a very significant percentage that you might say is almost 
inoculated against reaction to market changes. 
But there still is a very significant dollar value. There’s a fair amount held by funds, for example. 
And so the market value of what I would call the potentially tradeable A is likely to far exceed 
the market value of the potentially tradeable B. Now, it may be that all of the B is potentially 
tradeable, whereas, only a small portion of the A is. 
But that 40-billion-to-400-million ratio, I think, almost ensures that, after the initial flurry, that 
the better market — and when I say, “better market,” I mean the ability to move large dollar 
amounts in both directions with minimal movement of price — the better market — not by a 
huge margin — but the better market is likely to be in the A. And frankly, we hope that it is. We 
still hope there’s a good market in the B, obviously. 
But if you’re talking 10 shares of the A, which is a $300,000 or so investment, I think that, two 
months from now — that it’s likely to be that buying or selling $300,000 worth of A will have 
slightly less of a percentage impact than buying or selling $300,000 worth of B, but not by a 
significant amount. 
But that’s what I meant by that comment of having a slightly better market in the A than the B. 
And that’s important from our standpoint because, if that situation became reversed and the B 
became the better market, then people would have a real incentive to convert from A to B over 
time, and eventually the B market would dominate. 
We don’t anticipate that happening. And I think the way we’ve arranged it, it won’t happen. But 
it could happen. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, well, I think we’ve also created arrangements in the way we’ve 
written the prospectus and rewarded the selling brokers that tend to dampen demand, both 
individual and institutional. And we sometimes accomplish what we try to do. (Laughter) 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 4? Don’t ask us for a list of those, what we’ve accomplished. 
(Laughter) 
39. Corporate return on equity will probably drop 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Dan Pico (PH), Sioux City, Iowa. 
In the mid-’70s, you wrote an article on how inflation swindles the equity investor and that the 
average return on equity for corporate America would be like 12 or 13 percent. 
Last year, the average was more like 20. Have the laws of economics been repealed or 
modified? Or if not, what sort of calamities might occur as we revert to the mean? 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I have been surprised by returns on equity. There was a good article in 
Fortune about two issues ago. Well, it was in the “Fortune 500” issue, whenever that was. And 
it discussed the question of return on equity. 
And it made some good points about how the introduction of putting post-retirement health 
benefits on the balance sheet tends to swell equity returns subsequently. In other words, it 
moves down the denominator in terms of total equity employed. 
And there’s been a lot of big-bath accounting, where there have been write-offs, so that 
counting that, I don’t think it has gotten to 20 percent. But it’s higher than — it’s certainly 
higher than I anticipated when I wrote that article. 
And I would say that it would seem very extreme to me, in a world of — like we’re living in now 
— to have equity cap — returns on equity — close to the 20 — average close to the 20 percent 
rate over time. But it has surprised me, how high returns have been. 
Now, you have had situations like at Coke, for example, where 25 years ago, they would not 
have repurchased stock. And so, they’d have piled up more equity in the business. And Coke’s 
return on equity, if it had been following the policies of 1970 or ’75, would be far less than it is 
now. 
Coke really doesn’t need equity. And so, it can earn extraordinary returns and very large dollar 
sums. To the extent that impacts the figures, that has some impact on them. 
To the extent that General Motors sets up many, many billions of a reserve for post-retirement 
health benefits, that tends to make the returns on GM look a lot better than it did in the past, 
when it wasn’t even recognizing those costs and, therefore, had an equity that really was much 
larger than the true equity. 
So there have been some things happen like that. But all in all, I don’t think, under any system 
of accounting, the 20 percent returns for American industry are in the cards. 
Charlie? 
CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I agree. And I think that this business of having way more 
consolidation and the successful companies, like Wells Fargo, buying in stock, I think that’s had 
a huge effect, too. 
I don’t think it’s actually gotten that much — obviously, we had a long period of real growth 
and so on. And I think that, on average, business has earned higher returns on equity. But I 
think a whole lot of things have combined to goose the results. And I don’t see how it could go 
much farther. 
40. Buffett’s investment doesn’t reflect any real estate insights 
WARREN BUFFETT: Zone 5? 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. My name is Ted Elliott (PH) from Connecticut. 
The press reported a recent investment you made in the real estate business. And I wondered if 
you would comment as to your outlook for that business. 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, that’s just sort of an asterisk. I’ve got virtually everything in Berkshire, 
and I own a few municipal bonds outside and a few other things, but I don’t want to buy 
anything that Berkshire’s involved in. It just complicates life. And all the best things I like — 
(laughs) — are in Berkshire. 
So every now and then, some little thing happens to hit the radar screen that is too small, 
really, for Berkshire. And I’d bought a hundred shares of that company back when I — it’s called 
Property Capital Trust — I’d bought 100 shares of that back when we owned NHP, which had 
done a couple of deals with them. So I — my policy of reading every annual report in sight that 
can further my knowledge about anything, I bought 100 shares. 
And then I happened to see a year or so ago, where they said they were going to liquidate. So 
having some money around, I bought that. But it’s not based on any feeling about the real 
estate business, any sophisticated analysis of the company, or anything else. It’s a minor 
personal investment. 
I have no insights whatsoever. We’ve done a few things in real estate at Berkshire. But they’ve 
been large things. And there was a brief period when there were a couple things that were 
intelligent to do. 
If we’d started a little earlier, there might’ve been a lot more things. But we started a little late. 
So we’re doing nothing now. But we listen to things, occasionally. 
But we’re looking. We’re basically looking for big things at Berkshire. And we haven’t found 
anything in real estate in a long time. And we may never. 
But who can tell? I mean, we’ve got our oar in the water. And the couple things we’re in are 
working out fine. But they’re not significant relative to Berkshire’s size. 
41. Berkshire’s past growth not a yardstick for new investments 
WARREN BUFFETT: We’ll go to zone 6. And this is the last question because it’s going to be 3 
o’clock. And let’s have zone 6. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name’s Mike Nolan from New Jersey. My wife and I have been 
shareholders since 1984, and happy ones. Thank you both. Two questions today. 
In the retail store industry, in light of Berkshire’s outstanding 23 percent annual growth in book 
value per share and the industry’s roughly 8 to 9 percent growth in equity over the last several 
years, we wonder, why would Berkshire exchange stock for securities such as these, when the 
growth and the net worth of the acquired companies, if they’re anywhere near the industry 
average that you’ve acquired this year, are one-third or less? 
To quote Barnett Helzberg from the annual report, “The diamond business is a very competitive 
industry.” 
WARREN BUFFETT: Well, all retail is competitive. And both of those companies have averaged a 
lot better returns on equity than the numbers you cite for the industry. 
And the second point, you know, we have no way of making 23.6 percent in the future. So we 
do not use our historical — if we used our historical average as a yardstick for new investments, 
we would make no new investments because we don’t know how to make 23.6 percent in the 
future. 
But we like — we regard the retail business as a very tough business. We like the records of 
those companies, their market positions, and their managements. And when we find a business 
like that, and we feel very comfortable with the people running it, we will make the deal. 
But we won’t expect to make 23.6 percent on our money over time doing that. 
I’d like to thank everybody for coming. You’ve, you know — (Applause)
