      topic: "September 11 Aftermath",
      insight: "What September 11 should have taught us is that a shock to the system can occur at any time. Terror attacks, though vicious and highly disturbing, will never destroy our economic system. The American economy will continue to work fine long after you and I are gone. But, while I'm around, I prefer to operate with adequate margins of safety. As it turns out, I considered the risk of a mega-catastrophe so large that last April we entered into a special contract to protect Berkshire against losses that might occur from certain catastrophes.",

    {
      topic: "Derivatives",
      insight: "Charlie and I are of one mind in how we feel about derivatives and the trading activities that go with them: We view them as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system. In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen).",

    },
    {
      topic: "Accounting Integrity",
      insight: "When you hear a CEO talking about EBITDA, it's usually because of one of two reasons: Either the CEO wants to make a business with huge depreciation charges look good, or, alternatively, the CEO is unable to comprehend the consequences of the capital outlays that are required to generate the EBITDA. If that's the case, there's no way he should be running a business, because there are substantial capital expenditures that are absolutely required in virtually every business.",
      context: "Criticizing the use of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) as a misleading metric",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A", "ENRN"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Investment Strategy",
      insight: "If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes. Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio's market value. Though it's seldom recognized, this is the exact approach that has produced gains for Berkshire shareholders: our 'business-like' purchase of equity securities has substantially outperformed the casual, time-oriented 'strategy' of many other investors.",
      context: "Reiterating his long-term investment philosophy amid market uncertainty",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Corporate Governance",
      insight: "Why have intelligent and decent directors failed so miserably? The answer lies not in inadequate laws – it's always been clear that directors are obligated to represent the interests of shareholders – but rather in what I'd call 'boardroom atmosphere.' It's almost impossible, for example, in a boardroom populated by well-mannered people, to raise the question of whether the CEO should be replaced. It's equally awkward to question a proposed acquisition that has been endorsed by the CEO, particularly when his inside staff and outside advisors are present and unanimously support his decision.",

Corporate scandals began to emerge, with Enron's collapse in December raising serious questions about accounting integrity and corporate governance.",
