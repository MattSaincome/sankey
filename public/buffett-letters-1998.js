      topic: "Market Enthusiasm",
      insight: "The fact is that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company's promoters. At bottom, the 'business model' for these companies has been the old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers acted as eager postmen.",

    {
      topic: "Internet Revolution",
      insight: "The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors. The Internet is likely to change many things, but not the need for sustainable competitive advantages.",

      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Acquisition Discipline",
      insight: "In making these acquisition decisions, we consider three parameters: (1) The size of the 'moat' around the business, i.e., how well-entrenched is its competitive position; (2) The skill and passion of the management; and (3) The price. The last factor gets most of the attention from commentators, but we consider it far less significant than the strength of the business franchise and the quality of management.",

    {
      topic: "Value Investing",
      insight: "I'd rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. If you understood a business perfectly and the future of the business, you would need very little in the way of a margin of safety. So, the more vulnerable the business is, assuming you still want to invest in it, the larger margin of safety you'd need. If you're driving a truck across a bridge that says it holds 10,000 pounds and you've got a 9,800 pound vehicle, if the bridge is 6 inches above the crevice it covers, you may feel okay, but if it's over the Grand Canyon, you may feel you want a little larger margin of safety.",

    },
    {
      topic: "Management Quality",
      insight: "We've never been in a business where the CEO has grown tired of running it. And I think that's because if you have a great castle, most people don't want to leave it. There's a natural inertia to wanting to make it even greater. So the idea that people at the top of businesses are going to quit and go sit on a beach the rest of their life is not what I observe.",

Tony Nicely's leadership has produced extraordinary results: GEICO's growth has been far faster than that of the industry, and the company has meanwhile maintained an excellent underwriting record."

  economicContext: "1998 saw continued strong economic growth in the United States, with inflation remaining subdued despite low unemployment. The stock market, particularly technology stocks, showed extraordinary gains, while many 'old economy' stocks languished.
