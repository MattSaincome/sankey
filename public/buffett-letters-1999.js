      topic: "Technology Investing",
      insight: "We have embraced the 21st century by entering such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint. Try to control your excitement. Our move to such leading-edge industries may prompt the question: How did we, in the late 1990s, manage to snatch these companies from the hands of corporate acquirers who were eager to replace their stodgy, Old Economy management with executives who understand the New Economy?",
      context: "Sarcastically addressing the dot-com bubble and Berkshire's continued focus on fundamentals",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A", "BNI", "JCP"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Internet Bubble",
      insight: "The line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and clear, becomes blurred still further when most market participants have recently enjoyed triumphs. Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There's a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands.",

    },
    {
      topic: "Business Economics",
      insight: "In a business selling a commodity-type product, it's impossible to be a lot smarter than your dumbest competitor. In some businesses, the dumbest competitor has the most effect on prices. But if you're selling something that has an immense untapped demand and that for some reason feels like it has real, special characteristics that determine people's decisions, like Coca-Cola or See's Candies, then you can get a huge premium. It's like the story of Jack Welch having a car waxed: the guy charges $20, and Jack says, 'That's a lot.' The guy replied, 'Yeah, but I get it done in 20 minutes.' And Jack said, 'In that case, charge $40.'",

    {
      topic: "Share Repurchases",
      insight: "Repurchases are sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful discount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds intelligently: It's hard to go wrong when you're buying dollar bills for 80Â¢ or less. But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are made above intrinsic value.",

      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Acquisition Philosophy",
      insight: "We are searching for businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt. We see three ways to employ the excess cash these businesses generate: (1) Use it to expand the current business; (2) Acquire other businesses; (3) Repurchase shares or pay dividends. If neither of the first two options has substantial promise, we favor repurchases when a repurchase can be made below a business's intrinsic value.",

  economicContext: "1999 saw continued strong economic growth in the United States, with unemployment reaching record lows. The 'New Economy' thesis gained tremendous momentum, with Internet and technology stocks reaching extraordinary valuations.

The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates late in the year in response to concerns about inflationary pressures.",
