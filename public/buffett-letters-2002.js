  keyInsights: [
    {
      topic: "Corporate Governance",
      insight: "The current cry is for 'independent' directors. But the question is: Independent of whom? Too often, the answer has been 'independent of management.' That's not necessarily bad, but it's substantially inadequate. They need to be 'dependent' on shareholder-oriented judgment. The true test of independence is not whether directors are independent from management, but whether they are independent from everyone and focused solely on what's best for shareholders.",
      context: "Discussing boardroom reform in the wake of corporate scandals at Enron, WorldCom and others",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A", "ENRN", "WCOM"]
    },
    {
      topic: "CEO Compensation",
      insight: "Huge severance payments, lavish perks and outsized payments for ho-hum performance often occur because comp committees have become slaves to comparative data. No CEO looks at a proxy statement and says, 'I should make less than so-and-so because I'm facing fewer problems.' Instead, there's a ratcheting up effect: If someone is earning more for comparable work, everyone else wants to demand more. When I keep reading about $140 million CEO compensation as being 'within the range of companies that size,' I realize that if $140 million is the middle, there's someone out there getting $280 million.",
      context: "Criticizing excessive executive compensation practices",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Stock Options",
      insight: "If options aren't a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go? The accounting profession and the SEC should be shamed by the fact that they have long let themselves be muscled by business executives and politicians.",
      context: "Arguing that stock options should be expensed, contrary to prevailing accounting practices",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Derivatives Risk",
      insight: "I view derivatives as time bombs, both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system. Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices, or currency values. But the parties to the contract don't always inform their shareholders (or their regulators) about the huge leverage inherent in their positions. Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them.",
      context: "Warning about the systemic risk posed by derivatives",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A", "AIG", "C"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Insurance Float",
      insight: "What is float? Float is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, which may be years later. During that time, the insurer invests the money. The earnings from these investments – what we call 'the float' – are an important part of insurance company profits. Typically, insurers report a substantial underwriting loss in most years, but they offset that loss with investment income from the float. But Berkshire has been blessed with some insurance managers who have produced both excellent underwriting results and substantial growth in float.",

CTB fits our acquisition criteria perfectly: It's a leader in an unglamorous business with strong growth potential and managed by people who love their business, not their perks."

See's illustrates the power of owning a business with fundamental economics that range from good to great."
