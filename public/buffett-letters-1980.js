    {
      topic: "Inflation and Business",
      insight: "Inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm. That tapeworm preemptively consumes its requisite daily diet of investment dollars regardless of the health of the host organism. Whatever the level of reported profits, more dollars must be invested just to maintain the economic status quo.",
      context: "Explaining how inflation erodes business returns",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Return on Assets",
      insight: "The average American business has a ROA of about 12%. Such earnings do not expand significantly or irreversibly in value as the years pass. If they did, a business earning $12 million annually and possessing equity of $100 million would be worth far more than $100 million... If the business earns 12% on capital over forty years... that means little more than that a dollar reinvested in 1940 has become $36 or so forty years later.",
      context: "Discussing the limited long-term value creation of average businesses",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Business Value Creation",
      insight: "There are a few, but only a few, businesses that have been able to share their prosperity with workers (and communities, governments, and stockholders) while increasing the demand for their products. Leaving aside the human constants of fear and greed, the primary cause of failure and distress to a business is that they have committed portions of their resources to development of products that will not succeed in the marketplace.",
      context: "Explaining why some businesses succeed over time while others fail",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Equity Allocation",
      insight: "Equity is the best of all time, because you are a holder of equity, you own businesses that are retaining most of their earnings, and those earnings are being deployed in a manner that, on average, will produce about one dollar of market value for each dollar retained. That's the good news. The bad news is that those reinvested dollars earn a return of about 12%, which is no great bargain.",
      context: "Explaining the pros and cons of equity investments",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Exceptional Businesses",
      insight: "Our acquisition preferences run toward businesses that generate cash, not those that consume it. As inflation intensifies, more and more companies find that they must spend all funds they generate internally just to maintain their existing physical volume of business.",
