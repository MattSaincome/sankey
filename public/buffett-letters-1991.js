  keyInsights: [
    {
      topic: "Economic Goodwill",
      insight: "Businesses logically are worth far more than net tangible assets when they can be expected to produce earnings on such assets considerably in excess of market rates of return. The capitalized value of this excess return is economic Goodwill.",
      context: "Explaining the concept of economic goodwill versus accounting goodwill",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A", "KO", "GEICO", "WFC"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Market Fluctuations",
      insight: "In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine. The speed at which a business's success is recognized, furthermore, is not that important as long as the company's intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory rate. In fact, delayed recognition can be an advantage: It may give us the chance to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price.",
      context: "Discussing the disconnect between short-term market prices and long-term business value",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Management Quality",
      insight: "In making acquisitions, we have a strong preference for businesses that have been consistently profitable over a long period and that earn good returns on equity while employing little or no debt. Furthermore, we want management in place with a proven track record and an interest in being our partner.",
      context: "Explaining Berkshire's acquisition criteria",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Investment Principles",
      insight: "Charlie and I decided long ago that in an investment lifetime it's too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions. Therefore, we adopted a strategy that required our being smart - and not too smart at that - only a very few times. Indeed, we'll now settle for one good idea a year. (Charlie says it's my turn.)",
      context: "Discussing Berkshire's concentrated investment approach",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Business vs. Stock",
      insight: "Your goal as an investor should be simply to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily understandable business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher, five, ten, and twenty years from now. Over time, you will find only a few companies that meet these standards - so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock.",

      },
      buffettComment: "Gillette's business is pretty simple to understand: a couple of blades, a little chrome, and some great advertising... and men look forward to shaving everyday. Gillette has an incredible consumer franchise built on delivering an outstanding product that requires a 'useful', but low-cost, consumer item that customers have to keep buying. Gillette's profitability is not dependent on excessive capital investment or leverage. It's a business that would be great fun to manageâ€”if you know what you're doing."
