  keyInsights: [
    {
      topic: "Return on Equity",
      insight: "The primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.). The investment environment that exists today, as a by-product of double-digit inflation rates, makes the attainment of this goal tougher."
      context: "Discussing the impact of inflation on business returns",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Inflation's Impact on Business",
      insight: "Double-digit inflation acts as a tax on capital that makes much corporate investment unwise - at least if measured by the criterion of a positive real investment return to owners.",
      context: "Explaining how inflation impacts capital allocation decisions",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Equity Bias",
      insight: "Inflation should cause us to have an equity-biased rather than a bond-biased portfolio policy. Bonds are not the place to be these days. Sometimes they're appropriate, but not often.",
      context: "Discussing investment allocation during inflationary periods",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Insurance Float",
      insight: "The insurance operation overall has been a substantial plus for Berkshire shareholders. We have a truly major competitive advantage in the insurance business, which, if properly exploited, should enable the insurance operation to continue delivering significant value.",
      context: "Highlighting the advantage of insurance operations in generating investment capital",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A", "GEICO"]
    },
    {
      topic: "Good Businesses vs. Bad",
      insight: "Our experience has been that the manager of an already high-return business usually continues to be very practical in his capital allocation decisions. He's not usually willing to bankrupt a good business to expand a poor one.",
      context: "Explaining the importance of management quality in capital allocation decisions",
      relevantCompanies: ["BRK.A"]
