      topic: "Capital Allocation",
      insight: "Intelligent investing is not complex, though that is far from saying that it is easy. What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word 'selected': You don't have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.",
      context: "Discussing the importance of staying within one's circle of competence when investing",

    {
      topic: "Airline Industry Economics",
      insight: "As of yearend, we have begun to feel the effects of USAir's fiscal problems. The company has suspended its dividend on our preferred stock. At yearend, we carried this holding at $358 million, our cost. This valuation reflects both a large unrealized loss and an accrual for unpaid dividends. Regarding the small dividend we were paid last year, most of that looked shakier by the day and was written off in the fourth quarter. The business as a whole has been a disaster for many carriers, with aggregate losses since the advent of deregulation running to many billions, and continuing to rise. The temptation to be in this business is always there because the revenues are so enormous, but the economics mean that for most participants, it's also likely to deliver disaster.",

      topic: "Acquisition Criteria",
      insight: "We are searching for businesses that we can understand, with favorable long-term prospects, operated by honest and competent people, and available at attractive prices. We don't discuss our investment ideas - good, bad, or indifferent - unless legally required to do so, and you should be suspicious of anyone who offers to tell you what we are buying or selling.",

    },
    {
      topic: "Insurance Float",
      insight: "Since our insurance operation is our core strength, it is worth talking about in some detail. Our super-cat business was developed from scratch by Ajit Jain, who has contributed to Berkshire's success in a way that goes well beyond the bottom-line numbers. Charlie and I knew nothing about this specialized field until Ajit came along, and we continue to rely totally on his assessment and underwriting of super-cat risks.",

    {
      topic: "Share Repurchases",
      insight: "When companies with outstanding businesses and comfortable financial positions find their shares selling far below intrinsic value in the marketplace, no alternative action can benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases. Buying dollar bills for 60Â¢ is a good business, whether the bills are wrapped in a stock certificate, real estate, or something else.",

      buffettComment: "I've previously described our USAir investment as 'the most expensive seat in the history of American commercial aviation.' My impatience caused me to overlook something I've emphasized for decades: the primacy of economics over excitement. The airline industry's economics are inherently challenging, making it a poor long-term investment in most cases."
