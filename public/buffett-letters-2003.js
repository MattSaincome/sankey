      topic: "Currency Risk",
      insight: "During 2002 we entered the foreign currency market for the first time in my life, and in 2003 we enlarged our position. I felt then, and still feel, that our trade policies will put unremitting pressure on the dollar for many years to come. As our current-account deficit grows, so will the ownership of U.S. assets by foreign nationals. This force-feeding of American wealth to the rest of the world is now proceeding at the rate of $1.5 billion daily.",

    },
    {
      topic: "Junk Bonds",
      insight: "The profound recent changes in our economy have significantly widened the tolerance for loose monetary policies. People no longer have the job security that was long the norm, and households must now save for retirement. At Berkshire, we've therefore backed away from the junk bond market, in which inflationary effects can be particularly painful for investors. We're not, however, abandoning our investments in high-grade bonds of corporations, which should be more sheltered from inflation than junk bonds.",

    {
      topic: "Managerial Excellence",
      insight: "Our prototype for occupational fervor is the Catholic tailor who used his small savings of many years to finance a pilgrimage to the Vatican. When he returned, his parish held a special meeting to get his first-hand account of the Pope. 'Tell us,' said the eager faithful, 'just what sort of fellow is he?' Our hero wasted no words: 'He's a forty-four medium.' Now that's focus. That's also the way our managers look at their businesses.",

    },
    {
      topic: "Investment Approach",
      insight: "When Charlie and I read reports, we have no interest in pictures of personnel, plants or products. References to EBITDA make us shudderâ€”does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures? We're very suspicious of accounting methodology that is vague or unclear, since too often that means management wishes to hide something. And we don't want to read messages that a public relations department or consultant has turned out. Instead, we expect a company's CEO to explain in his or her own words what's happening.",

    },
    {
      topic: "Charitable Giving",
      insight: "Most corporate contributions simply follow the desires of the CEO (who often wants his donations to be aimed at gaining him respect, admiration, or maybe even a hospital wing) or that of employees (who want the corporation to give to things they wouldn't, or don't, give to on their own). Additionally, gifts to charitable foundations often become bureaucratic, with much of the money going to salaries and overhead, and with the donors' money funding charitable activities only many years after the decision to give is made.",
